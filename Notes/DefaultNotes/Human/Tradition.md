Great question! The short answer is: **people didn’t usually drink boiled water in the past because it wasn’t a common practice, and wine (or beer) was safer and more convenient.**

Here’s why:

### 1. **Knowledge gap**

* For most of history, people didn’t know about **germs** or waterborne diseases.
* They knew that some water made them sick, but they didn’t know *why*.
* Boiling water kills microbes — but without the germ theory (before the 1800s), they didn’t realize boiling made it safer.

### 2. **Taste and habit**

* Boiled water often tastes “flat” or strange, especially if cooled.
* Wine, beer, and ale had flavor and calories, so people preferred them.

### 3. **Preservation and storage**

* Once boiled, water can become contaminated again quickly if stored in dirty containers.
* Wine and beer, with alcohol and acidity, could stay safe for longer periods.

### 4. **Energy cost**

* Fuel (wood, coal) was expensive or scarce. Boiling all drinking water every day wasn’t practical for most households.
* Fermented drinks were made in bulk and lasted longer without needing daily fuel.

### 5. **Cultural tradition**

* Drinking wine, beer, or diluted versions (like “small beer”) was deeply ingrained in daily life, meals, and rituals.
* In many societies, even children drank weak beer instead of water.

👉 So, even though they *could* boil water, the combination of **lack of knowledge, taste, practicality, and tradition** made wine/beer the “safe drink of choice.”

Would you like me to also show you **when boiling water became common** as a health habit? (It has an interesting link with tea and coffee!)
