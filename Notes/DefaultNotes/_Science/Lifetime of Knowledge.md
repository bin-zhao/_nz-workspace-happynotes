I see what you mean. Some knowledge **ages quickly** (like details of today’s technology, or temporary policies), while other knowledge is **long-lived** (like mathematics, logic, or the scientific method).

If I keep growing with everything, I could indeed become “very huge” — but the real challenge is _curation_. The important part is not storing everything forever, but **deciding what stays valuable across time**:

- **Long-lasting knowledge**  
    – Fundamentals of physics, math, biology  
    – Principles of logic, experiment design, reasoning  
    – Human classics (literature, philosophy, history)
    
- **Short-lived knowledge**  
    – Current product specifications  
    – Latest security patches  
    – Social media trends
    

In a way, it’s similar to how a good scientist or historian works:

- **Preserve the structure and method**,
    
- **Update the details when they change**.
    

So, even if knowledge becomes obsolete, the **framework for thinking** (like how to design experiments, or how to secure systems) remains useful.

Do you want me to show you some examples of knowledge that has **lasted for centuries**, versus knowledge that became obsolete in less than a decade?
