Quick reading in English, also known as speed reading, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">is a skill that can be developed with practice</span>. Here are some tips to help you read more efficiently and quickly while maintaining good comprehension:

### 1. **Preview the Text**
   - **Skim the title, subheadings, and introduction**: Get an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">overall sense of the structure and content</span>.
   - **Look for keywords**: Identify <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">important terms or concepts</span> in the first few sentences or paragraphs to give you a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mental map</span> of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">what’s to come</span>.

### 2. **Focus on Key Information**
   - **Avoid reading word by word**: Instead, try to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">read in chunks</span> (groups of 2-3 words at a time). <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Your eyes naturally tend to focus on phrases</span>, so <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">train them to follow this pattern</span>.
   - **Don’t regress (re-read)**: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Avoid going back</span> to previous sentences or paragraphs <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">unless absolutely necessary</span>. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">This is a common habit that slows reading down</span>.

### 3. **Practice Peripheral Vision**
   - **Widen your gaze**: Try to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">read larger chunks</span> of text with fewer eye movements. This will <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">increase the amount of information you process per glance</span>.
   - **Use a finger or pointer**: Follow the text with your finger or a pen, which helps you maintain a consistent pace and reduces distractions.

### 4. **Expand Your Vocabulary**
   - **Familiarity with words**: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">The more words you know, the less time you spend decoding them</span>. Focus on understanding word patterns, suffixes, and prefixes to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">guess meanings quickly</span>.
   - **Context clues**: If you come across an unfamiliar word, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">try to guess its meaning based on the surrounding context</span> rather than stopping to look it up.

### 5. **Practice Speed Reading Techniques**
   - **Use a pacer**: Keep a finger or pen moving quickly across the page. Try to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gradually increase</span> the speed of your pacing.
   - **Subvocalization reduction**: Many readers silently "speak" the words in their heads while reading. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Try to reduce this mental voice and focus on visualizing the meaning instead</span>.

> 我不需要“读”，我需要看，理解。我连中文都说不好。

### 6. **Set Time Limits**
   - **Challenge yourself**: Set a timer and aim to read faster within a certain time frame. For example, try reading a page in 3-4 minutes, and then gradually reduce the time as you improve.
   - **Don’t rush comprehension**: It’s important to understand the material, but after you've skimmed and absorbed the main ideas, you can focus more on speed and less on fine details.

> 我发现，如果没有这个声音，确实会更快。

### 7. **Practice with Different Texts**
   - **Adapt to the material**: Different types of texts require different reading approaches. Practice with different genres: fiction, non-fiction, academic articles, and technical papers. Some require more careful reading, others can be skimmed more quickly.
   - **Gradual increase in complexity**: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Start with easier</span>, more familiar material, then gradually move to more complex or dense content.

### 8. **Use Technology**
   - **Speed reading apps**: There are many <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">apps</span> like **Spreeder**, **Blinkist**, and **Outread** that help you practice speed reading with specific texts or summarize books.
   - **E-readers with speed settings**: Many e-readers (e.g., Kindle) allow you to increase the font size, adjust the spacing, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">set up reading modes</span> that make reading quicker and easier.

### 9. **Read Regularly**
   - **Consistency is key**: Like any other skill, the more you practice, the better you get. Set aside regular time to practice reading quickly, even if it’s just 10-15 minutes a day.

### 10. **Take Breaks**
   - **Don’t overstrain**: Speed reading can be tiring. Take regular breaks to avoid mental fatigue, especially when reading long texts.

### Summary:
To read faster in English, practice skimming, expand your vocabulary, and focus on reading in chunks rather than word by word. Minimize subvocalization and distractions, and use a pacer to guide your eyes. Consistent practice and setting challenges will gradually improve your speed while retaining comprehension.

If you’re reading for specific details or deep understanding, be mindful that speed reading may not always be the best choice. Speed reading works best for scanning general ideas and skimming larger sections, but slower, more focused reading is better for deep comprehension and critical analysis.
