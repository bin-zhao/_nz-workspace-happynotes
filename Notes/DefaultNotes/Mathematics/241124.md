Yes, there are indeed many formulas in mathematics that are challenging to integrate, either because the integrals cannot be expressed in elementary functions or because they are computationally intensive. Some of the most well-known examples include:

  

### 1. **Gaussian Integral (Normal Distribution)**

The Gaussian integral is the integral of $e^{-x^2}$ over all real numbers:

  

$$

\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx

$$

  

This does not have an elementary antiderivative, but its value is well-known and is given by:

  

$$

\sqrt{\pi}

$$

  

Despite its simple form, the integral is not straightforward to compute using elementary methods without knowledge of specific techniques like completing the square.

  

### 2. **Elliptic Integrals**

Elliptic integrals are generalizations of many standard integrals involving square roots of polynomials, often in the form of:

  

$$

\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{(1-x^2)(1-k^2x^2)}}

$$

  

These integrals cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. Instead, they are defined in terms of elliptic functions, which are used in contexts like calculating the arc length of an ellipse, among other applications. Elliptic integrals are often computed numerically.

  

### 3. **Gamma Function and Factorial Integrals**

The Gamma function, which generalizes the factorial function for real and complex numbers, can be represented as an improper integral:

  

$$

\Gamma(z) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t} \, dt

$$

  

Although the Gamma function has been studied extensively and its values are tabulated, the integral itself does not have an elementary solution for arbitrary values of \(z\), and the process of evaluating it for non-integer values can be computationally intensive.

  

### 4. **The Fresnel Integrals**

The Fresnel integrals arise in the context of wave optics and are defined as:

  

$$

S(x) = \int_0^x \cos(\pi t^2 / 2) \, dt

$$

$$

C(x) = \int_0^x \sin(\pi t^2 / 2) \, dt

$$

  

These integrals do not have elementary closed-form expressions and are often computed using numerical methods or approximations.

  

### 5. **Riemann Zeta Function**

The Riemann zeta function, for example, is defined as an infinite series, but it can also be expressed as an integral for certain values of \(s\):

  

$$

\zeta(s) = \int_0^\infty \frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x - 1} \, dx

$$

  

While this formula is used to compute values of the zeta function, it becomes difficult to handle for many values of \(s\) and requires careful numerical methods for evaluation.

  

### 6. **Quantum Field Theory Integrals**

In physics, particularly in quantum field theory, integrals of path integrals or functional integrals can be extremely challenging. For example, integrals over space-time configurations in the presence of interacting fields can often be non-perturbative and difficult to evaluate, requiring approximations like perturbation theory, lattice methods, or Monte Carlo simulations.

### Summary

Many integrals that appear in advanced mathematics and physics cannot be solved in closed form using elementary functions. These include Gaussian integrals, elliptic integrals, the Gamma function, Fresnel integrals, and others. In many cases, the integrals are computed numerically or expressed using special functions. This reflects the complexity of certain mathematical concepts and the necessity of modern computational tools for solving real-world problems.
