Yes — that belief is basically correct, though the real story is more step-by-step than “one day a fish learned to breathe air.”

### The Big Picture

About **370 million years ago**, during the Devonian period, some fish gradually adapted to life on land. These fish are called **lobe-finned fish** (Sarcopterygii). They are the ancestors of all land vertebrates — amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals.

### How breathing air happened

Fish already had the raw tools for air-breathing, long before they moved onto land:

1. **Primitive lungs in fish**

   * Some ancient fish had **lungs** (not just gills).
   * Modern lungfish and bichirs still have them.
   * These lungs evolved from a pouch of the digestive tract (similar to how our lungs are connected to the throat).

2. **Air gulping**

   * In low-oxygen or stagnant water, these fish would come up to the surface and gulp air into their primitive lungs.
   * This gave them a survival advantage.

3. **Gills + lungs at the same time**

   * For a long period, they used both:

     * **Gills** for breathing in water.
     * **Lungs** for breathing air when oxygen in water was low.

4. **Gradual shift to land**

   * As some species ventured onto swampy land, their lungs became more important.
   * Limbs evolved from fins (Tiktaalik is a famous “in-between” fossil).

5. **Modern descendants**

   * Amphibians (frogs, salamanders) still show this dual strategy: they have lungs, but many can also breathe through their skin or gills at certain stages.

### So the exact process:

* First, fish evolved a **pouch-like lung** (originally as a flotation aid and extra oxygen source).
* They **gulped air into it** when water oxygen was too low.
* Over millions of years, this lung system became more efficient, while gills shrank or disappeared in land species.

So it wasn’t one single fish suddenly “deciding” to breathe air — it was a long adaptation, with lots of intermediate stages.

Would you like me to give you a concrete fossil timeline — like *who* came first, Tiktaalik, Acanthostega, Ichthyostega — so you can see the step-by-step change?
