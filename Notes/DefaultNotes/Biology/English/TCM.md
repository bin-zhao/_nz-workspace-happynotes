1. **Licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra / 甘草)**

   * Dried, sliced root commonly used in Chinese and Western herbal medicine.
   * “Sweet” because it naturally tastes very sweet (glycyrrhizin is 50× sweeter than sugar).
   * Used for cough, throat, digestion, inflammation.

2. **Codonopsis root (党参, Codonopsis pilosula)**

   * Often dried and sliced.
   * Mildly sweet and sometimes called “poor man’s ginseng.”
   * Used for fatigue, digestion, immunity.

3. **Astragalus root (黄芪, Astragalus membranaceus)**

   * Common in Chinese medicine, dried and sliced.
   * Slightly sweet taste.
   * Supports immunity, energy, and sometimes blood sugar regulation.

4. **Rehmannia root (生地黄 / 熟地黄, Rehmannia glutinosa)**

   * Dried root used sliced, either raw or prepared.
   * Sweet in taste according to traditional classification.
   * Used for cooling, nourishing yin, and treating conditions linked with diabetes (“sweet urine disease”).

My best guess: **jujube / Chinese red date (Ziziphus jujuba)**.

* Young fruit: green to light yellow.
* Ripe/dried: turns red to dark red (“red dates”).
* Small, round/oval; common in TCM and often dried in slices.

Other close candidates (in case you meant one of these):

* **Hawthorn (Crataegus / 山楂)** – small round fruit, turns bright red; dried as thin red-rimmed slices with a star-shaped calyx “scar” on one end; taste is tart/sour.
* **Goji berry (Lycium / 枸杞)** – unripe green, ripe orange-red; dried is red but the fruit is more oblong than round and smaller than jujube.

I think you’re pointing to the TCM concept of **“Qi <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">deficiency</span>” (气虚 qì xū)**.

It doesn’t translate perfectly into English because it’s not the same as “being weak” or “tired,” though weakness is one of the main signs.

**Qi deficiency (气虚)** in TCM usually means your body doesn’t have enough “vital energy” to function properly. Common symptoms include:

* **Fatigue / low energy** (feeling drained easily)
* **Weak digestion** (poor appetite, bloating, loose stools)
* **Shortness of breath** with little exertion
* **Spontaneous sweating**
* **Poor sleep / insomnia**
* **Sweet cravings** (what you called “sweetness”)
* **Weak immune function** (catching colds easily)

That’s why herbs like **astragalus root (黄芪 huáng qí)** and **jujube (大枣 dà zǎo)** are often prescribed — they’re considered **qi tonics**.

Do you want me to break down how this TCM “qi deficiency” maps (and doesn’t map) onto modern medicine ideas like **chronic fatigue, anemia, or low metabolism**?

The symptom you’re describing is **inflammation**.

* **Inflammation** = the body’s natural response to injury or infection, usually showing up as **redness, swelling, heat, and pain**.
* If your hand is injured, the redness and swelling happen because blood vessels widen and immune cells rush to the area to heal it.

The medicines we commonly use for this are called **anti-inflammatory drugs (or medicines)**.

* Everyday ones include **ibuprofen**, **aspirin**, or **naproxen**.
* In medical terms, they’re often grouped as **NSAIDs** (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).

Do you want me to also explain the **difference between inflammation in everyday injuries** (like a swollen hand) and **chronic inflammation** (which can happen inside the body, like in arthritis)?

Yes, I think you’re pointing to what Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) usually calls **“Qi deficiency with cold”** (气虚畏寒 / 气虚怕冷).

In TCM terms:

* **Qi (气)** is the body’s vital energy that powers warmth, movement, and protection.
* When Qi is weak or deficient, the body may fail to warm itself properly.
* The common symptom is a feeling of **chilliness or being cold**, especially in the hands and feet, even when the environment isn’t very cold.

Sometimes TCM texts simply describe this as **“怕冷” (aversion to cold)** or **“畏寒” (fear of cold)**, which can be due to **Yang deficiency** or weak Qi not circulating warmth.

So the short answer: the symptom is usually called **aversion to cold (畏寒)** or **fear of cold**, linked with **Qi or Yang deficiency**.

Do you want me to compare this with how Western medicine might explain the same feeling (like poor circulation, anemia, thyroid issues)?

In Traditional Chinese Medicine, **Qi deficiency with cold (气虚畏寒 / 气虚怕冷)** is usually treated by strengthening Qi and supporting Yang. That means the recipe should be **warm-natured, tonifying, and easy to digest**.

Here are a few **classic recipes** (food therapy style, not strong decoctions) often used:

**1. Astragalus Chicken Soup (黄芪炖鸡汤)**

* Ingredients: Astragalus root (黄芪), chicken, ginger, Chinese dates (jujube 红枣), a little goji berry (枸杞).
* Function: Astragalus strongly boosts Qi; chicken provides warmth and nourishment; ginger and dates warm and strengthen digestion.
* Suitable for: Fatigue, spontaneous sweating, aversion to cold, weak immunity.

**2. Ginseng and Jujube Porridge (人参大枣粥)**

* Ingredients: Ginseng (or American ginseng if you need something milder), Chinese dates, glutinous rice.
* Function: Restores Qi, strengthens spleen and stomach, supports Yang.
* Good if: The person feels weak, cold, and also has poor appetite.

**3. Ginger and Mutton Soup (羊肉生姜汤)**

* Ingredients: Mutton, fresh ginger, scallion, a little cooking wine.
* Function: Mutton is very warm (Yang tonic), ginger warms channels, drives out cold.
* Good if: The cold sensation is stronger, with more Yang deficiency signs.

**4. Dang Shen & Codonopsis Soup (党参汤)**

* If ginseng is too strong or expensive, Dang Shen (Codonopsis) is often used. Combined with jujube and ginger, it’s very gentle and good for daily Qi deficiency.

⚠️ Note:

* These are food-therapy style **recipes**, not strict TCM herbal prescriptions.
* If cold symptoms are strong, TCM doctors may prescribe herbal formulas like **Si Jun Zi Tang (四君子汤, Four Gentlemen Decoction)** for Qi deficiency, or **Si Ni Tang (四逆汤)** for severe Yang deficiency.

Would you like me to write you a **simple daily recipe (like porridge or soup)** that you could actually cook at home, without hard-to-find herbs?

In TCM, the opposite of **cold (寒 hán)** is **heat (热 rè)**.

These are the two major opposing patterns in TCM diagnosis:

* **Cold (寒)**: feeling chilly, preference for warmth, pale complexion, cold hands and feet, slow pulse.
* **Heat (热)**: feeling hot, preference for cool, red face, thirst, irritability, fast pulse.

They’re part of the basic **yin-yang balance**:

* Cold = yin excess or yang deficiency.
* Heat = yang excess or yin deficiency.

Would you like me to also explain how “cold” and “heat” in TCM correspond to symptoms in modern medical terms (like infection, inflammation, hypothyroidism, etc.)?

Modern Language

Okay, let’s make a sample dialogue that shows how you could explain “Qi deficiency with cold” to a modern doctor, using clear everyday English.

### <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Example doctor’s visit</span>

**Doctor:** What brings you in today?
**You:** Recently I’ve been feeling tired most of the time, even if I sleep well. I also notice that my hands and feet often feel cold, and I get chilled more easily than other people.

**Doctor:** Do you have any other symptoms?
**You:** Yes. My appetite is not strong, sometimes I feel full or bloated easily after eating. I also feel weaker than usual when doing normal daily tasks.

**Doctor:** Have you noticed changes in your skin, weight, or mood?
**You:** My skin looks a bit pale. I haven’t gained weight suddenly, but I do feel low in energy and sometimes low in mood.

**Doctor:** Do you get sick often?
**You:** I catch colds more easily than before.

### What the doctor might think about testing

* **Blood test for anemia** (hemoglobin, iron, B12, folate)
* **Thyroid function test** (to check for hypothyroidism)
* **Basic metabolic panel** (to check kidney, liver, electrolytes)
* **Vitamin D level** (low levels can cause fatigue)

### How to phrase it simply

If you want a one-sentence explanation, you could say:

> “I often feel tired, cold, weak, and catch colds easily. I’d like to check if I might have anemia, thyroid problems, or vitamin deficiencies.”

Would you like me to also prepare a **“translation sheet”**: common TCM patterns (like Qi deficiency, Yin deficiency, dampness, etc.) → how to explain them in modern symptom language for a doctor? That way you could use it whenever you need.
