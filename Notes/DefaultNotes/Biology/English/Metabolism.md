**Metabolism** ([/məˈtæbəlɪzəm/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English"), from [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language "Greek language"): μεταβολή _metabolē_, "change") refers to the set of [life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life "Life")-sustaining [chemical reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction "Chemical reaction") that occur within [organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism "Organism"). The three main functions of metabolism are: converting the energy in food into a usable form for cellular processes; converting food to building blocks of [macromolecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromolecule "Macromolecule") ([biopolymers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopolymer "Biopolymer")) such as [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein "Protein"), [lipids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid "Lipid"), [nucleic acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid "Nucleic acid"), and some [carbohydrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate "Carbohydrate"); and eliminating [metabolic wastes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_waste "Metabolic waste"). These [enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme "Enzyme")-catalyzed reactions allow organisms to grow, reproduce, maintain their [structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structures#Biological "Structures"), and respond to their environments. The word _metabolism_ can also refer to all chemical reactions that occur in living organisms, including [digestion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestion "Digestion") and the transportation of substances into and between different cells. In a broader sense, the set of reactions occurring within the cells is called intermediary (or intermediate) metabolism.
