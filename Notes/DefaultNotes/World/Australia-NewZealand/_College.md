我对贵校的人工智能专业非常感兴趣。
我工作15年了，一直从事游戏开发，目前在上海维塔士电脑软件有限公司就职，职位是Export SE，打算辞职去新西兰留学。我的最高学历是大专，专业是计算机信息管理。有一定的英语基础，但是没有语言认证，需要先学习英语。我想知道我能不能直接报贵校的人工智能专业，如果不能，麻烦给一些建议。

I'm interested in Massey University's Artificial Intelligence programs.

I have 15 years of game development experience (currently Export SE at Virtuos Games, Shanghai). My highest qualification is an Associate Degree in Computer Information Management. I plan to resign and study in NZ.

My English needs certification. Can I directly enroll in an AI program? If not, please suggest recommended pathways or prerequisite steps.

Subject: Inquiry Regarding Artificial Intelligence Programs - 15 Years Game Development Experience

Dear Massey University Admissions Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in your Artificial Intelligence programs.

I have 15 years of experience in game development, currently working as an Export SE at Virtuos Games in Shanghai. I am planning to resign from my current position to pursue further studies in New Zealand.

My highest academic qualification is an Associate Degree in Computer Information Management. While I have some foundation in English, I do not yet have formal language certification and anticipate needing to complete an English language program prior to commencing my studies.

I would like to inquire whether my background and qualifications would allow me to directly enroll in an Artificial Intelligence program at Massey University. If direct entry is not possible, could you please advise on the recommended pathways or preparatory steps I should consider? Any guidance on suitable programs, prerequisite courses, or language requirements would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Sincerely,

[Your Name] [Your Email Address] [Your Phone Number - Optional, include country code if outside NZ]
