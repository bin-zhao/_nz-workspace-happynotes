I went to hospital today, there were huge amount of people there, it was like a market. I didn't expect it when I sat in office.
Today, I went to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">the</span> hospital, and it was packed—there were so many people that it felt like a busy market. I never expected such <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crowds</span> when I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">was sitting</span> in my office <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">earlier</span>.

I still not felt well today.
I still <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">don’t</span> feel well today.

I tried to detect my physics situation using GPT, it did very well. I realized that it was not an impossible event when AI co-worked with doctors or took their job. If you find a way to make AI have more experience, they will do better than human at last.
I tried using GPT to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">assess</span> my physical <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">condition</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">it did surprisingly well</span>. It made me realize that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">it’s not far-fetched</span> to imagine AI <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">collaborating</span> with doctors—or <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">even eventually</span> taking over some of their roles. If we can find a way to give AI more real-world experience, it may eventually outperform humans in medical diagnostics.
