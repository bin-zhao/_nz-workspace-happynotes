My VPN didn't work today, I not so sure whether the issue is persistent, so I need a backup. I try to use HunYuan as a dictionary to help me to learn new word. It's not as good as Gememi. And I need to change my life now. I made a good plan, but it depended on some unstable things, it's out of control, it wasted my time. I think it's time to say bye to the place where I growed up. New doesn't mean good, but I don't need to be good. Live the remaining time for myself.
