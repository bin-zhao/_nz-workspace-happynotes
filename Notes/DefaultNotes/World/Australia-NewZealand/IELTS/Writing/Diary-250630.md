I try to learn English using pure English, no Chinese. When I learn a new word, the word is explanated by English. If the words in explanation are known, it's not very hard. But when there's some words unknown, it's a new word to learn. The process can keep continue util all words have explanations that have no new word. It's not easy as I think, and it's a challenge. I had tried to learn new word in this way for two days. It's difficult at the beginning, but now, I start to accept the press, authough, it still have lots work to do.
I'm trying to learn English using <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">only</span> English, without <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">relying on</span> Chinese at all. When I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">encounter</span> a new word, its meaning is explained using English. If all the words in the explanation are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">familiar</span>, it's not too difficult. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">However</span>, if there are unknown words in the explanation, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">then I have yet another new word to learn.</span> This process continues until all explanations <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">consist solely of words I already know</span>. It's <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">proving to be</span> more challenging than I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">initially thought</span>. I've <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">been trying</span> this method for two days now. It was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tough</span> at first, but I'm starting to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">get used to</span> the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pressure</span>, even though there's still a lot of work <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ahead</span>.

It's a 充实的 day, I feel I learned something. Consider health state, it's good enough.
It's been a **fulfilling** day; I really feel like I've learned something. Considering my health, that's good enough for me.
