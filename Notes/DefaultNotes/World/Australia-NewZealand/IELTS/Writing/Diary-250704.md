I found a good book to guide me how to practice writing, the book named "Academic Writing For Graduate Students". I can't wait to start to read it when I obtained it. There are some useful guide items at the beginning of the book, it's very useful for me, even I have no idea what's the whole picture of adademic writing. It's a practice book, no redundant words at the beginning. I just take a quick look to the first severial advices, I will read deeply of this book.
