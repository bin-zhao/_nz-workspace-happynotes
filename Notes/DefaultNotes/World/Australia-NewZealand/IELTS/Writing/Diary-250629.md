It's another deep night.
It's late at night again.

I try to made some tools to make transcript to help me do dictation. I had been coding for hours. At last, I finished an available version. I was very excited with it, it will very helpful to me. I tried it tonight, it worked very well.

I have keep talking with AI to practice English for three days. I have some improvement, even it's still in "survival English" stage. But I know, it's nothing more than practice.

I found I need to hard work if I want to using English well. I have no enough time to finish the daily task I planed. If I spent my time to practice listening, I will have no enough time to practice Writing. Add the size of the vocabulary is not reduce, it grows much faster than I learned one.
I've <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">realized</span> I need to **work much harder** if I want to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">use</span> English well. I don't have **enough time** to finish the daily tasks I've planned. If I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spend</span> my time practicing listening, then I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">won't</span> have enough time for writing. Plus, my vocabulary size isn't <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shrinking</span>; it's growing much faster than I can learn new words.

It's hard, but I'm not dispoint, it's the way to grow.
It's hard, but I'm not **disappointed**â€”this is just part of the growth process.<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">
