I'm still in the first stage, I need to take lots of time to expand my vocabulary, and review grammar. At the first stage, I have to reach the level equivelent to level at college. There's no chance to practice speaking now, so I can use these time to practice writing. I have two books on planning. Now, I need to focus on expand vocabulary.
I'm still in the first stage of learning, so I need to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spend</span> a lot of time <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">expanding</span> my vocabulary and reviewing grammar. At this stage, my goal is to reach a level <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">equivalent</span> to that of a college student. Since I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">currently</span> have no <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">opportunity</span> to practice speaking, I can use this time to focus on writing <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">instead</span>. I have two books on planning, but <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">right now</span>, my main priority is to expand my vocabulary.
