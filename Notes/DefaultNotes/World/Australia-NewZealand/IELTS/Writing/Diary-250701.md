It's good, however, the explaination and samples of word <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">could</span> be weird, it don't sounds naturally, or it could be worse, it may make mistake. And considering I need to prepare IELTS, I need some professional vocabulary. I will update my vocabulary tomorrow with more constraint to the test.

I think I needn't so hurry to start IELTS preparation. When I try to read each word correct, I found lots of words I familiar I cannot read them in correct way. I need to current my pronounciation first, This is the first step, this is the fundation.
