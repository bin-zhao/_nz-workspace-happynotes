When I made plan for IELTS preparation, I tried to learn new words in English only. So I can learn words in explanation and examples at the same time. You may think why bother to learn like that, just focus on the new word you learn, then move on to the next one. The idea behand that is learning word in sentence or context lead to strong memory, and you learn the usage of word at the same time. It's a good way to learn new words, but I encountered a new situation. I hadn't used English in daily life after school, and it's been a long time. I could write down a right sentence, after that, I am confused with it, am I right? is it the right way to use that word? Is the sentence grammatically correct? Even I know it's right, I have forgot which category the grammar sould be in. I realized I need to review all grammar knowledge I had learned before. It works. Even I reviewed only few hours, it can help me to type down this paragraph. I bet there will be less grammatical error when I check it with AI, you will see.

When I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">planned</span> my IELTS preparation, I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">decided</span> to learn new words <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">exclusively</span> in English—reading their definitions and example sentences in English rather than Chinese. You might <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wonder</span>, _Why bother? Why not just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">memorize</span> the word and move on?_ The idea <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">behind</span> this approach is that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">learning</span> words in context (within sentences) <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">strengthens</span> memory and helps you <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">understand</span> their usage <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">naturally</span>.
At first, it <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">seemed like</span> a great method. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">But then</span>, I faced a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">challenge</span>: I hadn’t used English in daily life <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">since</span> school, and it’s been a long time. Even when I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">managed to</span> write a correct sentence, I’d <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">second-guess myself</span>—_Is this the right word <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">choice</span>? Is the grammar correct?_ <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Sometimes</span>, even if I knew the sentence was right, I couldn’t <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">recall</span> which <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">grammar rule</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">applied</span>. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">That’s when I realized</span> I needed to review all the grammar I’d learned before.
It helped. Even after just a few hours of review, I could write this paragraph <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">more confidently</span>. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">I’m sure</span> an AI grammar check will show fewer errors—you’ll see.
