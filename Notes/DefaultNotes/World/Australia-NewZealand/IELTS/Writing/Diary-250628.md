It's too late now, so I need to keep diary today short.
It's too late now, so I need to **keep today's diary entry short.**

I found a powerful tool to assist me to practice English, which is, ElevenLabs.
It's really a fantastic tool. I can talk with AI to practice speaking. I can add a script and assign each sentence with different voice, so I can listen a conversion example. If I change the sentence to a single word, I can use it to dectation! I think it's hard to sleep tonight, I'm so 高兴.

Today is a sunny day, it's hot. Only few small pieces of cloud are hung on the sky. But at night, when I came back from super market, it's rainning. Luckly, it's not heavy.
