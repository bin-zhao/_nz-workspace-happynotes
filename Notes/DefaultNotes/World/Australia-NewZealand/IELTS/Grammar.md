Let's break down this paragraph sentence by sentence, identifying the grammatical structures.

**Sentence 1: "I love how much we sort of accidentally got almost right before germ theory, but I hadn't realized before checking out your book that we sort of backtracked a little bit when it came to airborne diseases."**

This is a complex sentence, consisting of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction ("but").

**Part 1: "I love how much we sort of accidentally got almost right before germ theory"**

- **"I"**: Pronoun, subject of the main clause.
- **"love"**: Verb, main verb of the clause.

    - **"how much"**: Adverbial phrase modifying "got" (indicating degree).
    - **"we"**: Pronoun, subject of the noun clause.
    - **"sort of"**: Adverbial phrase, softening the assertion <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">(informal)</span>.

- Two independent clauses ("I love how much..." and "I hadn't realized...")
- And at least one dependent clause (in this case, multiple noun clauses and an adverbial clause).

Excellent question. Let's break down these two related concepts: "Driving with" and "Driving judgment."

### What does "Driving with..." mean?

> Driving + with + impaired judgement
> It means driving in a hazardous state. Impaired judgement means you are not in good situation.

In the context of driving, the phrase "driving with..." is used to describe the **state or condition** under which a person is operating a vehicle. It signifies that something is accompanying or influencing the act of driving. This "something" can be a physical object, a person, a mental state, or an external factor.
Here are a few examples to illustrate the different uses:

- **A physical object:** "He was caught driving with an open container of alcohol."
    
- **A person:** "She was driving with her children in the back seat."
    
- **A medical condition:** "It is unsafe to be driving with uncorrected vision."
    
- **A mental or physical state (most relevant to your question):** "You should never be driving with extreme fatigue." or "He was arrested for driving with a blood alcohol level over the legal limit."
    
In your example, "Driving with impaired judgement," it means the act of driving is being performed while the driver's judgment is in a weakened or damaged state.

### What is "Driving Judgment"?

"Driving judgment" refers to the crucial set of mental skills and cognitive abilities a driver uses to make safe and effective decisions on the road. It's not just about knowing the rules of the road; it's about applying them in a constantly changing, real-world environment.
Good driving judgment involves:

- **Risk Assessment:** Accurately identifying potential hazards, such as a child about to run into the street, a car suddenly braking ahead, or slippery road conditions due to rain.
    
- **Decision Making:** Quickly and correctly choosing the safest course of action. Should you slow down, switch lanes, or stop? When is it safe to merge into traffic or make a turn?
    
- **Perception and Reaction Time:** Being aware of your surroundings (what you see, hear, and anticipate) and being able to react appropriately and swiftly.
    
- **Predicting Others' Actions:** Anticipating what other drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists might do next. For example, noticing a car in the next lane is drifting and predicting they might change lanes without signaling.
    
- **Self-Awareness:** Understanding your own limitations, such as fatigue or distraction, and adjusting your driving accordingly.
    
### Putting It All Together: "Driving with impaired judgement is extremely dangerous."

When you combine these two ideas, the sentence "Driving with impaired judgement is extremely dangerous" means:

**Operating a vehicle while your ability to assess risks, make sound decisions, and react appropriately is compromised is a highly hazardous activity.**

The impairment to your judgment can be caused by many factors, including:

- **Alcohol or drugs** (both illegal and some prescription medications)
    
- **Extreme fatigue** or drowsiness
    
- **Distractions**, such as texting, talking on the phone, or dealing with passengers
    
- **Strong emotions** like anger (road rage), anxiety, or sadness
    
- **Medical conditions** that affect cognitive function
    
In short, the phrase highlights that driving is primarily a mental task. When the mind's ability to judge is flawed, the driver becomes a significant danger to themselves, their passengers, and everyone else on the road.

## He worked as a janitor to put himself through college

> to put someone through something

In the sentence, "He worked as a janitor to put himself through college," the word **through** signifies **the entire duration of a process, from beginning to end.**

It's part of the common idiom **"to put someone through something"** (in this case, "college"). The meaning is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">to provide the necessary support, especially financial, to help someone complete a particular period or challenge.</span>

So, when "through" is used in this way, it means he worked as a janitor to pay for his tuition and support himself for the **entire time** he was attending college, with the goal of successfully finishing and graduating.

You can think of it as him entering college on one side and coming out the other side with a degree, and his job as a janitor was the means that carried him **through** that entire journey.

Here are other examples where "through" indicates a duration:

- "She worked **through** the night to finish the project." (from the beginning of the night to the end)
    
- "They managed to live **through** the difficult economic times." (from the start of the difficult times to the end)
    
- "He slept **through** the entire movie." (from the beginning of the movie to the end)

## The doctor attributed his chronic fatigue to a lack of sleep

> Attribute to

In the sentence, "The doctor attributed his chronic fatigue to a lack of sleep," the phrase "attributed his chronic fatigue" means the doctor **identified the cause or source of his chronic fatigue.**

Here's a breakdown:

- **Attributed:** This verb means to regard something as <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">being caused by</span> or as having originated from.
    
- **His chronic fatigue:** This refers to the ongoing, persistent feeling of tiredness or exhaustion that the person was experiencing.
    

So, the doctor linked the chronic fatigue directly to a specific cause, which in this case was a lack of sleep. It's like saying the doctor **blamed** the lack of sleep for the chronic fatigue, or **concluded** that the lack of sleep was the reason for it.

So probably the biggest climate story this year is that it's going to be the hottest year on record, which we know before it's even technically over.

Yes, you've precisely identified that "before it's even technically over" modifies "year."
Let's break down the grammatical structure:
Original Sentence:
"So probably the biggest climate story this year is that it's going to be the hottest year on record, which we know before it's even technically over."

**Breakdown of the Clause in Question:**

- **"which we know before it's even technically over"**
    
    - **"which"**: This is a **relative pronoun**. It refers back to the entire preceding clause, "it's going to be the hottest year on record." So, "which" represents the _fact_ that it's going to be the hottest year.
        
    - **"we know"**: This is the main subject and verb of the relative clause.
        
    - **"before it's even technically over"**: This is an **adverbial clause of time**.
      > <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">before + it's + even + technically over</span>
        
        - **"before"**: This is a **subordinating conjunction** that introduces the adverbial clause and indicates time.
            
        - **"it's"**: This is the subject of the adverbial clause, a contraction of "it is." Here, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">"it" refers back to the "year"</span> (specifically, the current year that is expected to be the hottest).
            
        - **"even"**: This is an **adverb** <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">modifying "technically over,"</span> emphasizing the unexpected early knowledge.
            
        - **"technically over"**: This is an **adjective phrase** (or a predicate adjective construction) <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">describing the state of the year</span>.
            

**How "before it's even technically over" modifies "year":**

The adverbial clause "before it's even technically over" is part of the larger relative clause "which we know before it's even technically over."
While the entire relative clause modifies the _idea_ of "it being the hottest year on record," the adverbial clause within it directly clarifies the _timing_ of that knowledge in relation to the **"year."**
Think of it this way:

- **What do we know?** We know that _this year is going to be the hottest on record_.
    
- **When do we know it?** We know it _before the year is even technically over_.
    

So, the adverbial clause explicitly modifies the **timeframe** associated with the "year" and the claim being made about it (that it's the hottest on record). It tells us _when_ this "hottest year" status is established relative to the year's completion.
Therefore, yes, in a grammatical sense, "before it's even technically over" functions as an **adverbial modifier of time**, providing crucial information about the **duration or completion** of the "year" in the context of the main assertion.

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">To</span> what **extent** do you agree with this statement?

Think of "extent" as representing a **range or a limit**. The preposition "to" specifies that we are inquiring about the **point or degree _up to which_ you agree** within that range.

Consider these analogies:
- "How far do you want to go **to** the park?" (indicating a destination or limit)
- "Up **to** what level can you swim?" (indicating a maximum degree or limit)

Similarly, "to what extent" means:
- "<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Up to what</span> degree..."
- "<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">To</span> what limit..."
- "How much (in terms of degree or scope)..."

---

A powerful <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">effect</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">that</span> something, especially something new, has <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">on</span> a situation or person.

### 1. Full Structure

**"Something has [X] on [Y]"**  
Here,

- **"something"** = the cause
- **"has"** = possesses or produces
- **"[X]"** = the effect or influence (like _an impact_, _an effect_, _a hold_, etc.)
- **"on [Y]"** = the target or person being affected

### 2. Meaning

So when you say:

> **"Something has [an effect] on a person"**

It means:

> That thing **influences**, **changes**, or **affects** the person in some way.

---

Identify is the fact of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">being who or what</span> a person or thing is.

### Let’s break it down:

1. **"Being"**
    - A **gerund** (noun form of the verb "be")
    - Part of the phrase: **"the fact of being who or what a person or thing is"**
    - It introduces the state of existence or identity — the general idea of **existing as** someone/something
        
2. **Final "is"**
    - This is a **main verb**
    - It completes the thought: **who or what a person or thing is**
        
So the full phrase means:

> "Identity is the fact **that someone exists as** (being) **whatever kind of person or thing** they actually **are (is)**."

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">exists as = being</span>

In other words:
- **"being"** = general condition or process
- **"is"** = actual identity at that moment

---

**Extent** refers to the degree to which something is or is believed to be the case, or the area covered by something. It indicates the scope or range of an effect or influence.

**Extent** 
refers to 
	the degree 
		to which 
		something is 
		or 
		is believed to be the case, 
	or the area covered by something.
