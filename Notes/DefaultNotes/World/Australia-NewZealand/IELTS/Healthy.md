The key is to choose **nutrient-dense snacks** that provide sustained energy, rather than sugary treats that lead to quick spikes and crashes.

Here are some good suggestions, categorized for different benefits:

**For Sustained Energy & Focus (Complex Carbs & Healthy Fats):**

1. **Nuts and Seeds:** Almonds, walnuts, cashews, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, chia seeds. They provide healthy fats, protein, and fiber for sustained energy and are packed with brain-boosting nutrients like Omega-3s and Vitamin E. _Pro-tip: Create a small trail mix with a few different types._
    
2. **Whole-grain crackers or toast with avocado or nut butter:** Complex carbs for steady glucose release, plus healthy fats and protein.
    
3. **Oatmeal (small portion):** Slow-digesting carbohydrates keep you full and energized for a longer period. Add some berries for extra benefit.
    
4. **Brown rice crackers:** A good source of complex carbohydrates.

**For Brain Boost & Concentration (Antioxidants & Vitamins):**

1. **Berries:** Blueberries, strawberries, raspberries. They are loaded with antioxidants that protect your brain and may improve cognitive function and memory.
    
2. **Dark Chocolate (70% cocoa or higher):** Contains flavonoids and a small amount of caffeine and antioxidants that can improve blood flow to the brain and boost mood. _A small square or two is enough!_
    
3. **Fruits:** Apples, bananas, oranges. Natural sugars for quick energy, plus vitamins and fiber. Bananas are great for potassium which can help with muscle function and nervous system health.
    
4. **Vegetable sticks with hummus:** Carrots, celery, bell peppers with hummus provide vitamins, fiber, healthy fats, and protein.
    

**For Protein & Satiety:**

1. **Hard-boiled egg:** Excellent source of protein and choline, which is important for memory and brain function.
2. **Greek yogurt:** High in protein and can be paired with berries or a sprinkle of nuts/seeds.
3. **Edamame (shelled):** A good plant-based source of protein and fiber.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Hydration:** Don't forget water! Dehydration can significantly impact focus and energy. Keep a water bottle near your study area and sip regularly.
    
- **Portion Control:** Even healthy snacks can be overeaten. Aim for small, satisfying portions.
- **Avoid:** Sugary drinks, highly processed snacks (chips, candy bars, sugary pastries), and anything that causes a rapid sugar spike and subsequent crash. These can leave you feeling more tired and less focused than before.
