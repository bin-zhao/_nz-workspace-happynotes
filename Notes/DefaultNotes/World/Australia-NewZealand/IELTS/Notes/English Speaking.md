Thanks for sharing this so openly. What you describe makes a lot of sense, and many language learners (and even some native speakers with processing differences) experience it. Let me break down what might be happening.

### 1. Reading words vs. hearing words

* **Reading**: You see the letters, your brain maps them to sounds you already know, and you can “decode” them at your own speed.
* **Listening**: The speaker controls the pace, sounds blend together, and you don’t get to “pause and look back.”

So, even if you can recognize a word in isolation, hearing it **in connected speech** makes it harder.

### 2. Why it’s hard to follow voices

* **Connected speech**: Native speakers link words, reduce sounds, and change stress (e.g. *going to → gonna*).
* **Processing load**: Your brain has to decode sound + remember meaning + keep up with speed, all at once.
* **Attention shift**: If you focus on *how* they say it (pronunciation), it’s harder to process *what* they say (meaning).

This creates the feeling that you “lose the thread” when listening.

### 3. Why copying voices feels difficult

When you try to make your voice more native-like, you’re doing **shadowing** (repeating after a speaker). But shadowing is cognitively heavy:

* Your ears must catch the sounds.
* Your mouth must reproduce them almost instantly.
* Your brain must keep pace with meaning.

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">That’s a lot of simultaneous tasks.</span> If you struggle with following, it’s natural that shadowing feels overwhelming.

### 4. What can help

Here are some practical adjustments:

* **Slow shadowing**: Use tools (like YouTube playback speed at 0.75x). First follow at a slower pace, then gradually speed up.
* **Phrase shadowing**: Instead of copying whole sentences, copy short chunks (e.g. *“I don’t know”*, *“what do you mean”*).
* **Dual-channel input**: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Read the transcript while listening.</span> This links your strong reading skills to listening.
* **Echo technique**: Don’t try to repeat instantly. Wait 2–3 seconds, then echo what you heard — <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gives your brain time to process</span>.
* **Listening-only drills**: Sometimes *don’t* shadow — just focus on catching the rhythm and reductions of native speech.

👉 So, to answer your “I don’t understand” feeling:
You *do* know the words, but listening involves **faster, messier, connected forms**. Your difficulty isn’t about vocabulary — it’s about processing speed and audio decoding.

Would you like me to give you an example sentence (native speed vs. reduced/connected form) so you can see exactly how words change when spoken? That might explain why following others feels so different from reading.

Yes — that’s a really sharp observation! Native speech **is very much like singing** in the sense that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">it has</span>:

* **Rhythm** (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables</span>)
* **Intonation** (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">the rise and fall of pitch</span>, like melody)
* **Tempo** (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fast and slow parts</span>, like musical timing)
* **Connectedness** (<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sounds blend</span>, like musical notes flowing together)

That’s why you notice it feels like a “song” — English especially is a **stress-timed language**, meaning <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">the beat is kept by stressed syllables, while unstressed ones squeeze in between.</span> For example:

> *I **WANT** to go to the **STORE** today.*
> The stressed beats are **WANT** and **STORE** — everything else (*I, to, go to the, today*) gets reduced, like background notes.

This musical quality is actually what makes English listening and speaking tricky but also beautiful — if you can “hear the song,” you can follow the flow more naturally, even if you miss some words.

Would you like me to show you a short everyday sentence, written both in “dictionary form” and in the “sung” rhythm a native speaker would actually use?
