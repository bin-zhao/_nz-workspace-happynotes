Perfect — let’s make each step very practical, so you can actually **do it after finishing an article** instead of just knowing the theory. I’ll give you simple routines + concrete examples.

## 1. Reading for Understanding (Depth)

**What to do:**

* After reading fluently, stop and **summarize the main point** in one or two sentences.
* Then pick **two details** that support it.

**Example (Article about climate change):**

* Main idea: *“The article argues that human activity is the main cause of global warming.”*
* Supporting details: *“It says fossil fuels release greenhouse gases,”* and *“deforestation reduces carbon absorption.”*

## 2. Expanding Vocabulary

**What to do:**

* Pick **3–5 new or interesting words/phrases** (not too many).
* Write them in a notebook with:

  * IPA (pronunciation),
  * a simple definition,
  * your own sentence.

**Example:**

* *deforestation* /ˌdiːfɒrˈeɪʃn/ → cutting down forests
* My sentence: *Deforestation in the Amazon is accelerating climate change.*

This way, the word becomes yours, not just the author’s.

## 3. Critical Reading

**What to do:**

* Ask yourself **2 questions**:

  1. *Do I agree or disagree with the article? Why?*
  2. *What is missing, or what would I add?*

**Example:**

* *Do I agree?* Yes, because there’s clear evidence of rising global temperatures.
* *What’s missing?* The article didn’t mention how renewable energy could replace fossil fuels.

## 4. Speaking Connection

**What to do:**

* Pretend you’re explaining the article to a friend.
* Record yourself (even 30 seconds).
* Use some of the new words.

**Example sentence (out loud):**
*“I just read an article about global warming. It says that deforestation is a huge problem because forests absorb carbon dioxide.”*

This step trains you to **move information from reading → speaking**.

## 5. Writing Connection

**What to do:**

* Write **one short paragraph** as a response.
* Try to use at least **2 new words** from your list.

**Example paragraph:**
*The article about climate change explained how deforestation increases global warming. I think the author is right, but they didn’t talk about renewable energy. Governments should invest more in solar and wind power to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.*

### 🔑 Suggested Routine (15–20 minutes after reading an article)

1. Summarize main idea + 2 details.
2. Write 3–5 new words with your sentences.
3. Answer 2 critical questions.
4. Record yourself explaining.
5. Write 1 paragraph response.

Would you like me to **create a full worked-out example** (step 1–5) using a short real article (maybe science or environment), so you can see exactly how the routine looks in action?
