Good question — in English there are a few overlapping words for the “stuff that gives food a special flavour.” Each has a slightly different focus:

1. **Spices**

   * Dried parts of plants (like seeds, bark, roots) used for strong flavour.
   * Examples: cinnamon, pepper, cumin, cloves.

2. **Herbs**

   * Leaves of plants used fresh or dried, usually more delicate flavour.
   * Examples: basil, parsley, rosemary, thyme.

3. **Seasonings**

   * A general word for anything added to food to improve its taste (includes salt, pepper, herbs, spices, sauces).
   * Example: “This soup needs more seasoning.”

4. **Condiments**

   * Sauces or preparations added at the table or in cooking.
   * Examples: ketchup, mustard, soy sauce, chili sauce.

5. **Flavourings**

   * A broader term, includes natural or artificial ingredients that give flavour.
   * Examples: vanilla extract, smoke flavour, MSG.

So if you want **one broad word** for *all the stuff that makes food taste special*, the best choice is **seasonings** or **flavourings**, depending on whether you mean natural ingredients (seasonings) or also artificial ones (flavourings).

Do you want me to make you a **vocabulary list with IPA, explanations, and examples** for these (spices, herbs, seasoning, condiment, flavouring)?
