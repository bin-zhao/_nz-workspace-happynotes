Both of your plans have merits for improving active listening for IELTS, but **Plan 1 (listen to single sentence and write down, or listen to an article, use listen-pause-write down iteration)** is generally more effective for the initial stages of IELTS listening preparation, especially if your goal is to "realize all words." Here's a breakdown to help you make a good choice:

**Analysis of Your Plans:**

**Plan 1: Listen, Pause, Write Down (Dictation/Transcription)**

- **Pros:**
    
    - **Focus on detail:** This method forces you to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pay extreme attention to every word</span>, its pronunciation, and even spelling. This directly addresses the concern about missing key points.
    - **Identifies specific weaknesses:** You'll immediately see where you struggle with specific sounds, vocabulary, grammar structures, or even numbers/dates.
    - **Improves spelling and note-taking:** Essential for the IELTS listening test where you need to write correct answers.
    - **Builds foundational accuracy:** <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Before you can summarize effectively, you need to be able to accurately comprehend the individual components.</span>
    - **Handles different accents:** <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Practicing dictation with various accents will help you tune your ear.</span>
- **Cons:**
    
    - **Can be slow and tedious:** This method is very intensive and might feel frustrating initially.
    - **Doesn't directly practice gist comprehension:** While it builds detail, it doesn't immediately train you to grasp the main ideas quickly.
    - **Not like real test conditions:** In the actual IELTS test, you cannot pause the audio.

**Plan 2: Listen to IELTS/Academic Articles, Only Make Summary for a Paragraph (Summarization)**

- **Pros:**
    
    - **Focus on main ideas:** This directly practices identifying the overall message and key points, a crucial skill for all parts of IELTS.
    - **Develops note-taking for gist:** You learn to filter out less important details and capture the essence.
    - **Simulates real-world comprehension:** In many situations, you need to understand the main idea rather than every single word.
- **Cons:**
    
    - **May overlook details:** If you're only aiming for a summary, you might miss specific facts, names, numbers, or spellings that are often required for IELTS answers.
    - **Doesn't address underlying word recognition issues:** <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">If you're missing words, you might struggle to form an accurate summary.</span>
    - **Less effective for initial accuracy:** If your aim is to "realize all words," summarization alone won't get you there.

**Recommendation:**

The person who told you to "realize all words" for IELTS listening is largely correct. Many questions in the IELTS Listening test require you to identify <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">specific details</span> (names, numbers, addresses, spellings, specific facts) which you will miss if you only focus on the general idea.

Therefore, **start with Plan 1 and integrate elements of Plan 2 as you progress.**

**Here's a suggested approach:**

1. **Foundation (Focus on Plan 1 heavily initially):**
    
    - **Sentence-by-sentence dictation:** Start with shorter audio clips or even just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">single sentences</span>. Listen, pause, and write down exactly what you hear. Then check with the transcript. This will expose your specific weaknesses with vocabulary, grammar, and phonetics.
    - **Paragraph dictation:** As you get better, try dictating <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">full paragraphs</span>, pausing more frequently at first, then trying longer segments.
    - **Use IELTS practice materials with transcripts:** This is crucial. Listen to an audio, write down what you hear, and then compare it with the transcript to identify errors.
2. **Transition to Comprehension (Integrate Plan 2):**
    
    - **After dictation, summarize:** Once you've accurately transcribed a paragraph or section from an IELTS practice test, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">then try to summarize it</span>. This helps bridge the gap between detailed understanding and main idea comprehension.
    - **Active listening without pausing (simulating exam conditions):** Once you feel more confident with dictation, start listening to IELTS audio (or academic articles) <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">_without_ pausing</span>.
        - **For questions that require specific details:** Focus on <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">identifying keywords</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">predicted information</span> (e.g., if a question asks for a number, listen specifically for numbers).
        - **For questions that require understanding the main idea (e.g., multiple choice about overall purpose):** Practice quickly grasping the gist while still noting important supporting points.
    - **Note-taking during listening:** Practice taking quick notes of keywords, numbers, and main ideas as you listen, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">without trying to write down every word</span>. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">This is vital for the actual exam.</span>
    - **Focus on distractors:** IELTS often includes "<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">distractors</span>" â€“ <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">information that sounds like the answer but is then corrected or changed.</span> Plan 1 (dictation) helps you catch these nuances.

**Key things to remember for IELTS Listening:**

- **You only hear the audio ONCE in the actual test.** Practice listening once.
- **Variety of accents:** Exposure to British, American, Australian, and other English accents is important.
- **Synonyms and paraphrasing are common:** The words in the questions often won't be the exact same as in the audio. Plan 1 (dictation with transcripts) helps you identify these.
- **Predicting answers:** Before the audio starts, use the time to read the questions and predict what kind of information you need (e.g., a name, a number, a place).
- **Don't get stuck:** If you miss an answer, move on. Don't dwell on it, as you'll miss subsequent answers.

By combining the meticulous detail-oriented practice of dictation with the broader comprehension practice of summarization, you'll develop a well-rounded set of active listening skills essential for achieving a high score in the IELTS Listening test.
