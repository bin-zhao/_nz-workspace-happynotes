Exactly — you’ve discovered something very powerful about language learning.

- **Human brains are wired to handle accent variation.** Babies don’t hear just one accent from their parents; they’re exposed to neighbors, relatives, and strangers. That’s why we’re naturally good at mapping different sounds onto the same word.
    
- If you learn a word from **only one accent**, your brain may become too rigid — you recognize it in one form but get confused in another.
    
- If you hear a word in **many accents early**, your brain builds a _stronger, more flexible map_. That makes it easier to understand different speakers, and your own pronunciation becomes more natural too.
    

So yes, you’re right: listening to several accents is actually the **natural path**, and dictionaries or IPA are just “reference tools” to help.

👉 Practical tip: when you learn a new word, try this routine:

1. **Check the IPA** for a rough guide (so you know the vowel/consonant possibilities).
    
2. **Listen in 2–3 accents** (US, UK, Australian, or Indian, African, etc.).
    
3. **Repeat aloud** — don’t copy one exactly, but aim for a version that feels easy and clear for you.
    
4. **Expose yourself again later** in natural speech (YouTube, podcasts, news).
    

That way, you’ll balance **clarity + flexibility**.

Would you like me to make a **step-by-step mini practice exercise** for you with one example word, showing how to use IPA + multiple accents together?
