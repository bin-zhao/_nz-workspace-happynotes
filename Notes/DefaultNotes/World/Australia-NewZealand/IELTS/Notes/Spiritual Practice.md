Say sentence, not words.
A word is composite with different components, it has accents.
<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Expression</span>, not say.
Say from lung. Lung -> Vocal cord -> Sound

Component - Word - Sentence - Intonation
Component - Intonation
No standard.
Speak like dance.
You may grasp the intention and the attitude before you catch the meaning.
A-B-C-D -> A-D, pattern is more important than clear.
You don't need to speak each word clear in general conversation, since your listener can grasp the pattern, and it can make the conversation effective.
