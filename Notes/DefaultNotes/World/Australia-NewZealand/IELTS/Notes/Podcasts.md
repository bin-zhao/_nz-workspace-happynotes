You've hit on a fantastic point! While natural conversation might use simpler structures, exposure to more formal academic English is crucial for improving your overall skills, especially for exams like IELTS. Podcasts are an excellent way to do this.

You're right that researchers, even in a "general conversation" _about their field_, would tend to use more formal and precise language. Spotify is a great platform with a vast selection.

Here are some Spotify podcast suggestions that frequently feature formal, academic, or more complex English, covering various topics often discussed by researchers and experts:

**General Knowledge & Critical Thinking (Excellent for Broad Academic Vocabulary):**

1. **Stuff You Should Know (SYSK):** While sometimes informal, their deep dives into complex topics often involve precise vocabulary and well-structured explanations. They cover science, history, culture, and more. They do tend to be more conversational, but the content is rich.
    
    - _Why:_ Broad topics, accessible but detailed explanations, good for understanding complex ideas.
        
2. **TED Talks Daily:** Short, focused talks by experts from various fields (science, technology, design, social issues). The language is often formal, persuasive, and precise.
    
    - _Why:_ High-quality, polished presentations; diverse topics; excellent for understanding persuasive language and structured arguments.
        
3. **In Our Time (BBC Radio 4):** This is a goldmine for academic language. Melvyn Bragg and three expert guests discuss a specific historical, philosophical, religious, or scientific idea/person/event for 45 minutes. The discussions are intellectually rigorous and use advanced vocabulary.
    
    - _Why:_ Very formal, intellectual discussions; deep dives into specific topics; exposure to high-level academic discourse. _Highly recommended for your goal._
        
4. **NPR's Up First / The Journal (Wall Street Journal):** For current events and economic news, these podcasts provide professional, well-articulated summaries and discussions.
    
    - _Why:_ Excellent for understanding formal news reporting and economic/political vocabulary.
        

**Science-Specific (Often featuring interviews with researchers):**

5. **Science Friday:** In-depth discussions about science topics, often featuring interviews with scientists themselves. The language is clear but assumes a certain level of understanding.
    
    - _Why:_ Direct exposure to scientific terminology and how researchers articulate their work.
        
6. **Science Vs:** Investigates fads and myths by examining the scientific evidence. Wendy Zukerman's clear, evidence-based approach involves precise language.
    
    - _Why:_ Good for understanding scientific methodology, critical thinking, and debunking common misconceptions with evidence.
        
7. **Nature Podcast / Science Podcast:** These are official podcasts from the world's leading scientific journals. They feature interviews with authors of papers published in the journals, discussing their latest research. This is as close as you get to listening to researchers explain their work directly.
    
    - _Why:_ Unparalleled exposure to cutting-edge scientific language and the way researchers talk about their findings. These can be challenging but rewarding.
        
8. **StarTalk with Neil deGrasse Tyson:** While it has a conversational and humorous element, Tyson and his guests (often scientists) discuss complex astrophysics and general science concepts using precise terminology.
    
    - _Why:_ Makes complex science accessible but still uses accurate scientific vocabulary.
        

**Other Academic Areas:**

9. **Hidden Brain:** Explores patterns in human behavior through a psychological and social science lens, often referencing research and theories.
    
    - _Why:_ Introduces social science vocabulary and critical thinking about human behavior.
        
10. **Freakonomics Radio:** Explores "the economics of everything," delving into various topics using an economic framework. Often features interviews with economists and other experts.
    
    - _Why:_ Great for understanding cause-and-effect reasoning, data interpretation, and economic/social science vocabulary.
        

**Tips for Practicing with These Podcasts:**

- **Don't worry about understanding every single word.** Focus on the main ideas and trying to infer meaning from context.
    
- **Re-listen to difficult sections.** Play back a segment a few times.
    
- **Use the transcript (if available).** Some podcasts offer transcripts on their websites, which can be invaluable for cross-referencing and checking vocabulary.
    
- **Note down new academic vocabulary or phrases.** Look them up later.
    
- **Focus on sentence structure.** Pay attention to how complex ideas are linked together using conjunctions and dependent clauses.
    

Enjoy your listening journey! This is an excellent way to immerse yourself in richer English.
