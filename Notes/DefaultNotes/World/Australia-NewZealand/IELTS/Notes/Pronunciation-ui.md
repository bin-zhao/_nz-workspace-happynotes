## **2. /juː/**  (“yoo” sound, like in *few*)

**Pattern:** Often in words related to *suit*, *pursuit*.

## **5. Special / borrowed pronunciations**

Some are borrowed from French, Spanish, or other languages and keep non-standard values:

* silhouette /ˌsɪl.uˈet/ (French origin)
* Quito /ˈkiː.toʊ/ (Spanish origin, “ui” not pronounced as in English)
* Trujillo /truːˈhiː.oʊ/ or /truːˈjiː.oʊ/ (Spanish origin)

If you like, I can make you a **practice reading list** that cycles through each of these “ui” sounds in minimal-pair style, so you can train your mouth and ear to switch between them quickly. This is especially helpful if you’re trying to read aloud fluently without stumbling.
