FLORA LICHTMAN: Hi, this is Flora Lichtman, and you’re listening to Science Friday.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Today on the show, can a treatment for PTSD be painless?

YASMIN TAYAG: To claim that you can treat PTSD without having the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">patient</span> face their <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fears</span>, it’s just sort of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">anathema</span> to– [LAUGHS] the field.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

FLORA LICHTMAN: About 7% of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">veterans</span> experience PTSD, and that number can be as high as about 30% for those who’ve served in a war zone. And yet, PTSD has been treated roughly the same way since the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">disorder</span> was first recognized roughly four decades ago. Patients are instructed to revisit <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">trauma</span> head-on until the memory no longer creates an emotional response. But this process is so <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">harrowing</span> that over half of veterans are unable to complete the full course of treatment.

So what if there was a way for PTSD treatment to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">virtually</span> painless? Yasmin Tayag, staff writer at The <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Atlantic</span>, investigated a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">controversial</span> treatment called <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reconsolidation</span> of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">traumatic</span> memories and explored the challenges of even studying a treatment that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bucks</span> conventional <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wisdom</span>. Yasmin, welcome back to Science Friday.

YASMIN TAYAG: Thanks so much for having me.

FLORA LICHTMAN: So you begin your piece through the lens of a patient, Jeff Turner. Tell us his story and how he ended up trying this alternative <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">therapy</span>.

YASMIN TAYAG: Yeah. So Jeff Turner was an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Iraq</span> war veteran. And when he told me about his trauma, he referred to an experience where he was leaving a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mess</span> hall. He was having breakfast like any other day. And then the next thing he knows, the mess hall blows up, and there’s another explosion right by him.

He kind of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">panics</span>. He <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ducks</span> under a mail truck. And next thing he knows, somebody is chasing after him and is saying, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Sergeant</span>, you’re covered in blood. And fortunately, his <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">injury</span> was relatively <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">benign</span>. He didn’t get hit in the head. He got hit in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wrist</span> and leg.

But very soon after the event, the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">symptoms</span> of PTSD began. And that looked like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">flashbacks</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">irritability</span>, memory loss. And they continued for years, even though he was trying all sorts of other treatments, including the gold standard treatment, which is called <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">prolonged</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">exposure</span>. This is like exposure therapy.

And somebody suggested he try this new therapy called reconsolidation of traumatic memories. And at this point, Jeff is like, whatever. Sure, let’s try it. And after four sessions, he told me his flashbacks just disappeared. And he <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">literally</span> described it like magic.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Wow. So how is this treatment different from the standard treatment for PTSD?

YASMIN TAYAG: So for a long time, the go-to treatment has been something called prolonged exposure. Prolonged exposure is a form of talk therapy that essentially involves the patient living through the traumatic memory over and over and over again until it no longer <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">elicits</span> the same kind of fear.

So reconsolidation of traumatic memories, it’s essentially a painless treatment. Big <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">claim</span>. And to continue like the movie <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">analogy</span>, I think of RTM as similar to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Inception</span>, where they go into the person’s mind to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">manipulate</span> a memory directly without having the patient experience that trauma over and over again.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Hmm. What are the sessions like?

YASMIN TAYAG: So they’re pretty <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">weird</span>. Well, they start off fairly normal. You’re in a room with your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">therapist</span>, and you set the start and end of the memory that you’re going to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tackling</span> that day. And then the therapist has you close your eyes. And you’re told to imagine yourself in a movie <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">theater</span> where your trauma is playing out on the screen. Only you then become <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">disembodied</span>, float up to the projection <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">booth</span>, and are watching your seated self watching the screen watching your traumatic memory.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Everybody who does this is instructed to imagine themselves in a movie theater, and then float out of their body and watch their traumatic experience on the screen?

YASMIN TAYAG: Yes. This is part of the protocol. And as you watch your traumatic experience play out on the screen, your therapist is in the room with you, watching you. And the moment you show the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tiniest</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">flicker</span> of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">discomfort</span>, they’ll have you stop. And so they never want you to experience discomfort.

And then your therapist will say, OK, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tweak</span> the video so that it’s a little easier to watch. Maybe you’ll turn it into a black and white film, or maybe you’ll make everyone a stick figure. And you’ll keep repeating this process over and over, tweaking your film until it is easy and boring to watch, no longer <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">eliciting</span> emotion. And that’s stage one of this process.

And then on to stage two. You return to the movie theater, but you step into the film itself, which is much more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vivid</span> than it was in the first stage. And the idea is you have to learn to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">withstand</span> this as well.

And finally, when that is easy enough to do, you move on to the final stage where the therapist asks you to just reimagine a totally different ending to your trauma– completely different. It can be anything. And that is the end of the treatment.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Is there science <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">underpinning</span> this? Do we know if you can rewrite your memories in this way by putting yourself in a movie theater and floating out of your body?

YASMIN TAYAG: So yes. reconsolidation of traumatic memories is based on this theory of reconsolidation. And it’s this idea in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">psychology</span> that memories that we might have once thought of as fixed, set in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cement</span>, are not actually permanent. You can modify them by reactivating them in certain ways.

RTM is a way of manipulating that process, of reactivating that memory, editing it a little bit, and then <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">filing</span> it back away into your brain in its <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">altered</span> state. And it’s supposed to stay that way in your brain <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">permanently</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: You talked to a patient for whom it seemed to work. Have there been <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">clinical</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">trials</span> or studies looking at its <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">effectiveness</span>, this treatment’s effectiveness?

YASMIN TAYAG: So there are four clinical trials, all published in peer-reviewed journals, but they’re all done by the creator of RTM. The outside experts I spoke to about these existing trials generally agree that they were not done very well.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Is it being evaluated now?

YASMIN TAYAG: So right now, a very well-respected <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">scientist</span> with the army named Michael Roy has just completed the first large-scale, truly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">comparative</span> clinical trial, where he compares people treated with RTM and people treated with the gold standard, prolonged exposure.

And this study is really exciting because it truly will be the first time that RTM has been studied in a very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rigorous</span>, very scientific way. And the results are not out yet. But the early data that he’s shared with me all seem to suggest that RTM is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">worthwhile</span>. It can work as well as the gold standard treatment.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Hmm. How is RTM viewed by the field?

YASMIN TAYAG: A lot of people just don’t about it. But those who have heard of it, at least the ones I spoke to, were all kind of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">skeptical</span>. I think there is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">resistance</span> in the PTSD research field for two reasons.

One is that there just isn’t that much data on RTM. But the second is that I think there’s a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">philosophical</span> reason people are pushing back. Because to claim that you can treat PTSD without having the patient face their fears, it’s just sort of anathema to [LAUGHS] the field.

Everything that we know about prolonged exposure is based on this idea of you have to face your fears. Even people outside of the medical field, we have sayings that are like, you have to face your fears, face your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">demons</span>. It’s just in our culture. So the idea that you don’t have to face your fears in order to get past them seems a little <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">implausible</span>, I think, to a lot of people.

FLORA LICHTMAN: You contrast TM with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">psychedelics</span>. In the piece, you go to a conference, and the psychedelics session is the keynote, and there’s hundreds of people there. Whereas, the RTM session is in a tiny ballroom and few people are there.

YASMIN TAYAG: Yeah.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Are psychedelic treatments for PTSD showing <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">promise</span>?

YASMIN TAYAG: Yeah, they really are. But what I will note is that most of the ongoing studies on psychedelics, they combine the psychedelics with talk therapy. Often, it’s the old prolonged exposure therapy.

And so I found that kind of interesting that people were so excited about this new treatment <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">paradigm</span> when, in fact, it’s not totally new. It’s almost like an add-on to something that has already existed for a long time.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Hmm. You spent a year reporting on RTM. It’s a little niche. Why did you think it was worth covering?

YASMIN TAYAG: I was aware that there was a real feeling of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stuckness</span> in the PTSD treatment world. For years, we’ve been hearing about the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">staggering</span> rate of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">suicides</span> among veterans with PTSD. And I had known from previous reporting that a lot of the current treatments weren’t working.

And so when I heard about RTM, I think like most of the people I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">interviewed</span> for this story, I thought, that seems unlikely. I’m skeptical. But there’s always been a part of me, and there is even now after I’ve written the story, that thinks, why not try?

We’ve clearly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">exhausted</span> the existing <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">possibilities</span>. We’ve shown their limits. And especially with a treatment like RTM which doesn’t appear to have a downside. Even if it doesn’t work, it’s not like the process is painful or expensive. Why not try?

But I think <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">regardless</span> of any philosophical <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">qualms</span>, theoretical qualms you might have with a treatment like this, I think you really just have to remember why you’re doing this. At the end of the day, does the patient have less severe symptoms? And if the answer is yes, then I think that should be an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">indication</span> that you keep going.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Well, thank you so much for sharing your reporting with us.

YASMIN TAYAG: Thank you for having me. It’s been such a pleasure to talk about it.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Yasmin Tayag is a staff writer for The Atlantic based in New York City.
