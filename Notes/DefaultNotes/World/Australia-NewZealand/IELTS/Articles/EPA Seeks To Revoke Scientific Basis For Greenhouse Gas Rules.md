IRA FLATOW: This is Science Friday. I’m Ira Flatow. This week, the Trump <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">administration</span> indicated that they’ll seek to roll back a key EPA finding that allows the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">agency</span> to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">regulate</span> greenhouse gas <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">emissions</span> from things like cars and power plants. Here with the details and other stories from the week in science is Sophie Bushwick, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">senior</span> news editor at New Scientist in New York. Welcome back, Sophie.

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: Thank you.

IRA FLATOW: You’re welcome. OK, what is this rule? How does it interact with how the EPA regulates things?

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: Well, the finding itself, it’s called the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">endangerment</span> finding, is basically the basis of the EPA regulating power plants and vehicles. Like you said, without it, there would be a major <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">deregulatory</span> effort. Our reporter, James Dinneen, spoke with a lot of climate <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">scientists</span> who described this report in less than glowing terms.

They described it as <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">flimsy</span>. Someone called it <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nutty</span>. One researcher, whose work was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cited</span> in the report, has called it a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">farce</span>. And so there’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">overwhelming</span> scientific <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">evidence</span> that supports the endangerment finding, and already the EPA is going to face a lot of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pushback</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">legally</span>. And they’re open to public comment as well if they want to try to move forward with this.

IRA FLATOW: What exactly is the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">aim</span> here, to take away all the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">basis</span> for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">regulation</span>?

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: Yes. The claim is that it’s bad for the economy to limit the emissions that power plants and vehicles are allowed to do and that, by <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">repealing</span> the endangerment finding and removing those regulations, it would be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stimulating</span> to the economy.

IRA FLATOW: Well, we seem like we’re turning the clock back.

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: It does seem like an attempt to do that, yes.

IRA FLATOW: So is this a done deal? Or is this just a possible outcome?

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: This is just a possible outcome. And already there is organizations <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lining up</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lawsuits</span> to try to prevent this. The EPA is opening a public comment period, so people will be able to comment on this and to voice their disagreement if that’s what they choose to do. So this is just the beginning of a process.

---

IRA FLATOW: All right. Let’s switch gears to another kind of emission. Tell us about the news this week, re– the search for life outside our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">solar</span> system and an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">exoplanet</span>.

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: That’s right. So earlier this year, the exoplanet K2-18B became one of the leading candidates for life because researchers were able to detect what they said was a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">signature</span> of these <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">molecules</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dimethyl</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sulfide</span> and dimethyl <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">disulfide</span>. And these two molecules on Earth are only produced by life. So that would really suggest some exciting news.

The problem is, when you’re talking about something as far away as this planet, it’s 124 light years away. And the way that we figure out what’s in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">atmosphere</span> is basically researchers look at the light from the star that this planet relies on. And as that light passes through the planet’s atmosphere, it can tell us what molecules are there.

But you have to do some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">statistical</span> analysis. There’s different ways of interpreting the data. And so that’s made this a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">controversial</span> finding.

So first there was pushback from other researchers who <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reassessed</span> the data and found no evidence. Then the original researchers looked at the data again and did their own <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reanalysis</span> and said it supported their finding. And now researchers have looked at new data, and one of the researchers on the original study says this supports the finding. But other researchers said it shows this isn’t a sign of life at all.

IRA FLATOW: Wow. (SARCASTICALLY) <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Controversy</span> in scientists? Scientists disagree with one another? Wow.

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Wild</span>, right?

---

IRA FLATOW: Wow. Wild. Let’s get back here on Earth for a bit. The conflict between Russia and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Ukraine</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stretches</span> on, and there’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">unfortunately</span> an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">innovation</span> in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">warfare</span> technology. Tell us about that.

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: Well, from the beginning of this conflict, cheap, small <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">drones</span> have played a role. And recently people have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spotted</span> these drones that are equipped with solar panels. So they don’t come with solar panels. They’ve been <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fitted</span> with them.

And the idea is that this could keep a drone charged and allow it to lay in wait to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ambush</span> someone. So almost like the drone has become a new kind of land <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mine</span>, it can just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lurk</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">indefinitely</span> until a target comes near.

IRA FLATOW: Is this a Ukrainian or a Russian drone?

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: This seems to be coming from Russian forces. But the fact is that if Russian forces are able to modify drones in this way, Ukrainian forces could do the same thing. And so this might become a much more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">widespread</span> thing.

IRA FLATOW: Yeah, because the Ukrainians are pretty good at drones, aren’t they?

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: That’s right. One of the really interesting things about this conflict is the use of tools like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hobbyist</span> drones that maybe weren’t intended for warfare originally, but people are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">innovating</span> and turning them into <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">military</span> tools. I mean, whether we think that’s a good thing or a bad thing, it depends on your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">perspective</span>. But this adding solar panels to it is now the latest <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">twist</span> in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">saga</span>.

IRA FLATOW: So it could lurk around for as long as the solar panels.

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: That’s right. It seems to be– the panels right now that they’re using are a little heavy. And again, these drones weren’t designed with that type of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">modification</span> in mind, so that might limit the amount of power it’s allowed to get out of it.

It might be something like the power wouldn’t be used to keep the drone flying, but it could allow the drone’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sensors</span> to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">recharge</span>. So if the drone parks itself in some location and then it uses these chargers to keep its sensors alive, it could just not move and keep a digital eye out for anyone coming near. And then once it senses a target, that’s when it kicks into gear and flies there to attack.

---

IRA FLATOW: There’s another tech that’s a bit more hopeful, and we’re talking here about <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">batteries</span> based on <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rust</span>. Wow, they should see my old car. They could make–

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: [LAUGHS] I think this is such a cool idea. And I mean, this is based on the idea that when you’ve got <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">renewable</span> power, it <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ebbs</span> and flows. Solar panels are great when the sun is shining, but you need some sort of battery to store that power for the times when the energy is not so <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">abundant</span>. And so a lot of times that means plugging a battery into the grid that is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">manufactured</span> in C made out of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lithium</span> iron <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">phosphate</span>.

And the problem is those batteries, they don’t hold charge for as long as you would like, just about four to six hours. And they can be quite expensive. So now researchers have developed a battery made from some of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cheapest</span> materials you can find, air and iron. And the claim is that these can hold their charge for 100 hours or longer.

IRA FLATOW: Sophie, I find this rust battery thing something I have to know more about. Give me some more details on this.

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: Right. So the way this works is it charges by– it takes <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">electricity</span>, feed it into the system, and it uses that to convert iron <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">oxides</span> into– iron oxides are a form of rust, and it transforms this rust back into iron. And then when it’s time for the battery to discharge, it can release this energy by reacting with oxygen in the air to turn back into rust.

IRA FLATOW: Wow. And so this is– because rust is everywhere, this is really cheap, right?

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: Right.

IRA FLATOW: You don’t need special <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">minerals</span>, hard to dig up out of the ground, to do this.

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Exactly</span>. That’s one of the really cool things about this. It’s just taking iron and turning it into rust and then turning it back into iron. And that’s how the battery works, which means what you need is air, which we have a lot of, and iron, which is pretty easy for most places to source.

---

IRA FLATOW: Wow. Let’s move on from rust to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">diamonds</span>. I already think of diamonds as super strong, the strongest materials on Earth. But there’s now a new <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">champion</span>, a new, stronger diamond in town?

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: Yes, diamonds can be made even stronger by growing them in a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hexagonal</span> shape. So the way that diamonds are is they are molecules ordered in a cubic <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crystalline</span> structure. And researchers have seen hints that you could have hexagonal diamond, but it’s only been found in small amounts. And that’s when it’s mixed in with cubic diamonds.

And researchers have tried to grow it before, but until now, they haven’t succeeded. And now they’ve grown a relatively large sample of hexagonal diamond. And it’s mostly 100% hexagonal without any cubic diamond mixed in.

IRA FLATOW: Wow. Wow. I’m not getting that any time soon in my <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">jewelry</span> store, I don’t think.

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: Maybe not. It’s still going to take some work to grow it in larger amounts. So far they’ve grown a piece that’s about 1 <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">millimeter</span> wide, so very, very small. But if they could scale this up, the hexagonal diamond is about 60% harder than your regular diamond.

IRA FLATOW: Really?

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: Which means it could be used for things like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">drilling</span> and making much more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">resilient</span> tools.

---

IRA FLATOW: Love it. All right. You know I love <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">weird</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">quantum</span> stuff, and you have a story about how quantum <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">entanglement</span> might not just be a one-time thing? Tell me about that.

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: This is super cool. So when two particles are quantum <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">entangled</span>, it means they’re linked together in such a way that they can do things like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spooky</span> action at a distance. They have all these weird shared behaviors.

And you’re used to thinking about quantum entanglement like a link. But what if you could think about it as a bank, something you could <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tap</span> into? Researchers found out that if you have a pair of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hypothetical</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">experimenters</span> and they’ve got these entangled particles, they can share that entanglement with another pair of experimenters. And then it can be shared again and again. In fact, they can keep on doing this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">indefinitely</span>, as if our little bank of entanglement is an almost infinite one.

IRA FLATOW: Wow. Why would they want to do that? Why do we care?

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: Well, if you want to have something entangled, which entanglement is required for things like quantum computing or quantum communication, you can create entanglement from <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">scratch</span>. But the idea is sharing it might be an easier way to get more entanglement out there.

IRA FLATOW: Sure, I get that. I get it. Finally, something <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sweet</span> to end on, a super old sample of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">honey</span>. Really?

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: That’s right. So near <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Pompeii</span>, there’s this ancient <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shrine</span>. And in it, researchers, in 1954, they found these <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pots</span> with a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sticky</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">residue</span>. And they thought at the time that it was animal or vegetable fat, but they noticed it was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">contaminated</span> with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pollen</span> and insect parts.

And then now researchers have used more advanced techniques to analyze the residue of this substance. They’ve used things like gas <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">chromatography</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mass</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spectrometry</span>. And they found a lot of sugars and some complex <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">acids</span> and some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">proteins</span> that are found in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">royal</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">jelly</span>. They even found some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">protein</span> fragments from a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mite</span> that we know feeds on <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">honeybees</span>. So we’re pretty sure that this pot used to hold ancient honey.

IRA FLATOW: Anybody stick their finger and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">taste</span> it to see if it was?

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: [LAUGHS] Unfortunately, these were <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">corked</span>, and the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">seals</span> have since <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">degraded</span>. And so I don’t think you would really enjoy tasting whatever is left of this honey. Bacteria has gotten into it. It’s not going to be a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">yummy</span> taste, but we know it once was. Maybe <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Winnie</span> the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Pooh</span> can try it.

IRA FLATOW: [LAUGHS] All right, Sophie. Always great to have you come and talk with us. Thanks for taking time to be with us today.

SOPHIE BUSHWICK: Thanks for having me.

We have to take a break. And when we come back, scientists have successfully trained a robot to perform <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">surgery</span> without the help of a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">surgeon</span>.

AXEL KRIEGER: We didn’t expect that we would get to a point where we didn’t need any human <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intervention</span>, so this was really even better than we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">anticipated</span>.

IRA FLATOW: You’ve had surgery recently, your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">surgeon</span> might have been a robot. Yeah, almost a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">quarter</span> of all surgeries in the US use robots. But don’t be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">alarmed</span> because every one of the robot’s movements in the operating room is actually controlled by a surgeon.

But there is change in the wind because, for the first time, researchers at Johns Hopkins University have trained a robot to do surgery on its own, a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">portion</span> of a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gallbladder</span> surgery, on a test pig <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cadaver</span>. The encouraging results were published last month in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">journal</span> Science Robotics.

Joining me now to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dissect</span> how he trained the robot to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">accomplish</span> this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">feat</span> and what it means for the future of robotic surgery is my guest, Doctor Axel Krieger, associate professor in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mechanical</span> engineering at Johns Hopkins University, based in Baltimore, Maryland. Welcome to Science Friday.

AXEL KRIEGER: Thank you so much for having me.

IRA FLATOW: You’re quite welcome. Can you walk me through what part of the surgery the robot was able to perform all by itself?

AXEL KRIEGER: Yes. There are about three large portions of gallbladder surgery. The first one is a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dissecting</span> the gallbladder from the liver bed. The second part– that’s what we really focused on– is the precision clipping and cutting of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">artery</span> and the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bile</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">duct</span>.

So this is going in with small little clippers and identifying where the artery is, placing three <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">plastic</span> clips in it, and then identifying where the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bile</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">duct</span> is, then placing three plastic clips in that, and then dissecting between the clips so that the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gallbladder</span> then in the third <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">procedural</span> step can be effectively removed.

And so that’s a very complex, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lengthy</span> step and really requires a lot of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">precision</span>. And there’s a lot of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">deformation</span> of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tissue</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">anatomical</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">variations</span> even between healthy pigs.

IRA FLATOW: Right. So how do you train a robot to do this?

AXEL KRIEGER: We used a technique called <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">imitation</span> learning. We can effectively now watch expert surgeons perform these steps and then repeat these steps over and over and then train a network to learn to then <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reproduce</span> those steps. So we can <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tie</span> what the robot sees to what the robot should do, so it’s a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hierarchical</span> framework that first <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">predicts</span> the right phase of the surgery and then predicts what the robot should do, given the certain video image that the robot sees currently.

IRA FLATOW: What happens if the robot makes a mistake? I mean, is it able to correct itself before it does something really bad?

AXEL KRIEGER: Yeah. The really nice thing that we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">demonstrated</span> in our study is that our robot is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">capable</span> to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">adapt</span> to small little <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">misplacements</span>. So imagine if the clipper doesn’t catch the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">artery</span> perfectly on the first try. The system <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">automatically</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">recognizes</span> that and then self-<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">corrects</span>.

That’s one way, so self-correction by the robotic systems. And then also the surgeon would then be the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">supervisor</span> and could always stop and take over and complete the procedure manual if necessary. In our study, in eight <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">consecutive</span> pick surgeries, we didn’t need any <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">interventions</span>. But if something <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">unforeseen</span> happens, the surgeon can always <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intervene</span> and take over.

IRA FLATOW: Were you surprised yourself just how well the robot performed here?

AXEL KRIEGER: Yeah, super exciting result. When we set out on this project, we didn’t expect that we would get to a point where we didn’t need any human intervention. So this was really even better than we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">anticipated</span>.

IRA FLATOW: Let’s talk about getting to that point. How do you get to that point? How big a jump in technology is this new robot from other older ones?

AXEL KRIEGER: It’s a major step forward. In older systems, we were able to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">automate</span> maybe one small task, one little step. And now tying these steps effectively together and recognizing small mistakes and then <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">consecutively</span> performing these sub steps to do a big chunk of a surgical procedure, that’s a huge step forward.

IRA FLATOW: Yeah, because you’ve been designing robots to do this itself for a few years now, right?

AXEL KRIEGER: Absolutely. We published a study in 2022 where we did a step called the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">anastomosis</span>, so that’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">suturing</span> of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tubular</span> structures. And so we were able to perform that suturing step. But what’s really exciting now is that we can boost up the success rate. And we have this framework that is more general, so we can train it for all different types of procedures, not just one step. But by adding more data, we can just learn more procedures and really get closer to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">clinical</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">viability</span> of this technology.

IRA FLATOW: I watched a video you put online of the robot actually doing this work, and I was surprised how well it did it. I mean, how does the robot’s work compare to a human surgeon?

AXEL KRIEGER: In our study, we really wanted to demonstrate the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">feasibility</span> of this technology, so we didn’t do a very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">thorough</span> evaluation comparing to expert surgeons. We did a small little comparison to one surgeon and showed that our robot is a bit slower. We ran it quite slow so we can <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intervene</span> if something happens. But the movement was more smooth compared to the expert surgeon, so really some early <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">indication</span> that we are getting on <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">par</span> with even an expert surgeon there.

IRA FLATOW: And what about other kinds of surgeries? Now that you’ve had success with this, do you see you’re able to expand to others besides just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gallbladder</span> surgery?

AXEL KRIEGER: Yeah. For us, this is a fantastic starting point. Gallbladder surgery was the first surgery that was performed <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">minimally</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">invasively</span>, so has this lighthouse character of a new technique for surgery. So that’s why it’s such a good target.

But we are excited to use this technology now for other applications, for other surgeries. A big one that we are working on right now is precision <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tumor</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">resection</span>, where it’s so difficult to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">delineate</span> where the tumor is from the healthy tissue and cutting that out. That is so difficult for surgeons, and we really want to use this technology to improve surgical techniques.

IRA FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah, I was going to ask you about the benefit of a robot that can do surgery without human intervention. But you’re saying here that in some cases it can do better than the surgeon.

AXEL KRIEGER: Yeah, that’s what we are working on. So integrating <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">preoperative</span> scans effectively, so seeing where the tumor is on other imaging and then combining it effectively with surgical videos, that’s the next big goal that we’re working on. And that is very hard for human surgeons to map these things together in their head, and so doing this with a robot we might be able to even boost expert <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">surgical</span> performance.

IRA FLATOW: Are you saying a robot <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">independent</span> of a surgeon <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">guiding</span> it or with surgeon supervision?

AXEL KRIEGER: Always surgeon supervision. Our goal is not to replace surgeons. We want to just make the surgery easier and help surgeons work with this rising <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">caseload</span>.

We have an aging society, more surgeries needed. And so the individual caseload is doubling in the next 10 years. So how can we help surgeons with that? How can we do an effective surgery later in the day when the surgeon might get <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tired</span>? By helping the surgeon, not having to do every part and every little step of every surgery but then, for portions of it, just watch the robot do it and then <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intervene</span> if necessary. That can really improve the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">effectiveness</span> and the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">efficiency</span> of surgeries.

IRA FLATOW: A lot of surgeries are done today through <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lap</span> surgery, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">laparoscopy</span>, right? Can the robot do that also?

AXEL KRIEGER: Yeah, absolutely. So the big improvement of using surgical robots is making it easier to do <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">laparoscopic</span> surgery, minimally <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">invasive</span> surgery. So <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">traditionally</span>, surgeons had to perform large <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">incisions</span> and work with the organs directly, with the hands, guidance directly with the eyes. Now we use cameras and small ports, and we use surgical tools in ports. And the surgical robot that we are working with is a minimally invasive <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">keyhole</span> surgery robot, and so we can do this procedure <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">minimally</span>, yes.

IRA FLATOW: All right. Now, we have listeners who are listening to this, and they’re going to ask, how do I get in on this? How soon might <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">patients</span> see <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">autonomous</span> robots, perhaps this gallbladder surgery, in the operating room?

AXEL KRIEGER: We are super excited to take the next steps and go to do a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">preclinical</span> study. So demonstrating this in live pig surgeries, that’s our next steps that we are very, very hardworking on right now. I also see that, similarly to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">modern</span> cars where we have some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">autonomous</span> functions, like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">brake</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">assist</span>, park assist, those autonomous functions, we see those coming in surgical <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">robotic</span> systems for the next few years.

So for example, the FDA approved recently a camera system that can follow the surgery autonomously. So the camera is moving autonomously, not the surgical tools. And now we can see maybe <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">suction</span>, maybe holding tissue, those things to be coming over the next few years. It’s going to take a while before procedures like gallbladders are implemented <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">clinically</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">commercially</span>, but we can definitely see the path forward for those.

IRA FLATOW: So what’s your next work here? You were studying this on a pig <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cadaver</span>. Do you ever get to the living, breathing pig section?

AXEL KRIEGER: That’s exactly the next step. So we demonstrated this on pig cadavers, and now we are working very hard to see if we can do this in a living pig. That would be the next step. And then if we demonstrate that this is safe and effective, then we can really design a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">first-in-human</span> study and work on the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">regulatory</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">approval</span> for that.

IRA FLATOW: What’s the most challenging part about creating and training these robots?

AXEL KRIEGER: The most challenging part is getting the right training data. So we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">acquired</span> about 30 different cadavers from <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">butchers</span> and then tested on all different <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">anatomy</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">variations</span> in the lab to acquire our testing data. And we also needed to predict how our robot might make small little mistakes and then add them manually to the training data, so start some procedures with maybe the clipper or the cutter being a little bit <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">misaligned</span> from the target so that we can self-correct then during the procedure.

So you become a bit of a robot <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">whisperer</span>. You <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">anticipate</span> mistakes, how could I fail? and then add that to the training data. So that’s probably the most complex part of our work.

IRA FLATOW: We have run out of time. I didn’t get to ask you about how a robot <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">scrubs</span> up for surgery, but that’s for the next time. We can talk about that.

AXEL KRIEGER: Thank you so much. That was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fantastic</span> questions.

IRA FLATOW: You’re quite welcome, and come on back when you’re working in a little more in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vivo</span> in live pigs.

AXEL KRIEGER: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Absolutely</span>. Would love to come back. Thank you so much for your interest and this fantastic interview. Really enjoyed it.

IRA FLATOW: You’re welcome. Doctor Alex Krieger, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">associate</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">professor</span> in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mechanical</span> engineering at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.
