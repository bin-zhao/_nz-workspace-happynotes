## Paragraph Summarize

here

---

Long ago central China had bamboo aplenty, which worked really well for the adapted pandas.

很久以前，中国中部有大量的竹子，这对适应了环境的大熊猫来说非常有利。

But many of those bamboo forests have been cleared for development in more recent decades.

但在最近几十年，许多竹林已经被砍伐用于开发。

As a result panda numbers have dwindled.

因此，熊猫的数量逐渐减少了。

In 1972, when wild panda populations were hovering around 1,000, First Lady Patricia Nixon mentioned that she really loved pandas at a dinner in Beijing.

1972年，野生大熊猫的数量已徘徊在1000只左右。第一夫人帕特丽夏·尼克松在北京的一次晚宴上提到她真的很喜欢大熊猫。

Important government officials were at the table, and soon after China offered two pandas, one male and one female, to the American people.

当时两国重要的政府官员都在场，不久之后，中国向美国人民提供了两只熊猫，一雄一雌。

The Nixons decided that the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, D.C., would be the perfect home for them.

尼克松一家决定将它们安置在华盛顿特区的史密森尼国家动物园。

"On behalf of the people of the United States, I am pleased to be here and accept the precious gift of the panda-pandas and also these other mementos from the government of the People's Republic of China."

我很高兴代表美国人民来到这里，接受中华人民共和国政府珍贵的礼物——熊猫，以及其他纪念品。

The new arrivals drew huge crowds.

大熊猫的到来吸引了大批人群前来参观。

The zoo staff members were hoping to learn more about the pandas in captivity to help regrow the wild population.

动物园的工作人员则希望更多地了解圈养大熊猫的情况，以帮助恢复其野生种群。

But answers turned out to be elusive.

但答案却难以捉摸。

In the 20 or so years that the pandas lived at the zoo they produced five offspring, but none of the animals lived past a few days.

在熊猫生活在动物园的大约20年里，它们共产下了五只幼崽，但没有一只能存活几天。

And it wasn't just a problem in D.C. Everyone was experiencing a similar panda babymaking issue, which continued into the early 2000s, when Pierre joined the National Zoo team.

这不仅仅是华盛顿特区的问题。每个机构都遇到了类似的熊猫繁殖问题，这种情况一直持续到21世纪初，此时皮埃尔加入了国家动物园团队。

Around then different institutions started sharing notes and collaborating to see if they could figure out what was going wrong.

也大约在那时，不同的机构开始合作并交流经验，以弄清楚哪里出了问题。

Only one pair of animal is not necessarily enough to understand the full spectrum of the biology of a species.

但仅仅一对动物不足以了解一个物种生物学的全部。

And going to China was very important, because there was access to many more animals.

因此去中国是非常重要的，这样可以接触到更多的大熊猫。

And, of course, as you can imagine, you know, individuals are not necessarily similar.

不过，正如你想象的那样，个体不一定相似。

So there was the possibility to study a lot of animals and to understand what was really the needs in terms of nutrition, in terms of veterinary care and in terms of monitoring of the reproduction.

因此，只有研究数量足够多的动物，才能了解其在营养、兽医护理和繁殖监测方面真正的需求是什么。

Researchers already knew that the breeding window for giant pandas is only open one time each year, usually from March to May.

研究人员已经掌握，大熊猫的繁殖窗口每年只开放一次，通常是在3月到5月。

But what they later figured out, through their own research and a lot of collaboration, is that within the three months of opportunity, there's an even smaller window.

但是，他们后来通过研究和合作又发现，在这三个月的机会中，还有一个更小的机会窗口。

The female is not necessarily able to conceive during the whole breeding season.

雌性不一定能够在整个繁殖季节受孕。

She can attract a male, but there is a very short window of time when the female can breed with the male and then conceive.

虽然她可以吸引雄性，但雌性与雄性交配，且能受孕的时间窗口非常短。

That very short window is about 24 to 72 hours maximum.

这个非常短的窗口最多是大约24到72小时。

Once Pierre and his colleagues defined the female panda's conception window within the breeding season, they needed to figure out the precise right time to bring the two pandas together and let sparks fly.

一旦皮埃尔和他的同事确定了雌性熊猫在繁殖季节的受孕窗口，他们就需要找出确切时间，将两只熊猫放在一起并擦出爱情火花。

What is the optimal time to put the male and the female together to make sure that there would be a successful breeding, leading then after that to a pregnancy and a baby.

那么将雄性和雌性放在一起的最佳时间是什么时候，才能确保成功繁殖，怀孕并生下幼崽？

In 2000 China sent over two more pandas on loan to the National Zoo.

2000年，中国又向美国国家动物园租借了两只大熊猫。

And the chemistry between these two was different.

而且这两只大熊猫之间的化学反应是与以往不同的。

They really showed all the good signs that they liked each other, that they were ready to breed during this very short breeding season.

它们展示出了所有的好迹象：它们彼此喜欢，愿意在这个非常短暂的繁殖季节进行繁殖。

Unfortunately, they were not really experts, and they were spending way too much time to try to adjust, you know, their positions, and it was way too long.

但不幸的是，它们不是很擅长，不得不花时间调整姿势，而最终花费的时间太长了。

And at some point it was very frustrating for both individuals.

某种意义上，这对于我们和它们来说都非常令人沮丧。

The zoo decided to separate the animals and instead pursued artificial insemination.

动物园最终决定将它俩分开，转而进行人工授精。

This is a tricky procedure in any species, but with giant pandas it's even more complicated.

这在任何物种中都是一个棘手的过程，而对于大熊猫来说，情况则更加复杂。

Pierre and the team needed to pinpoint the exact right time for the procedure, which required them to collect a lot of data.

皮埃尔和团队需要确定这一过程的确切时间，这需要收集大量的数据。

And by data, I mean urine.

数据，也就是尿液。

We don't draw blood because it's too invasive, but we have developed a technique, especially the endocrine lab, they have developed a technique to track the hormones in the urine.

我们不抽血，因为这太具侵入性了。因此我们已经研发了一种新技术，尤其是内分泌实验室，他们已经研发了一种技术来追踪尿液中的激素。

So that means the scientists regularly collected urine from the female panda and compared what they found there with her behavior.

这意味着科学家们能定期从雌性大熊猫身上收集尿液，并将发现与她的行为进行比较。

They could see each other through a mesh, they could smell each other, they could really rub each other, so we could definitely see what were the good signs in terms of behavior.

它们可以通过网眼看到彼此，闻到彼此的气味，还能互相摩擦，所以我们肯定能看到行为方面的良好迹象。

After about five years of tracking hormones and vibes the team's hard work finally paid off!

经过大约五年对激素和情绪追踪，团队的辛勤工作终于得到了回报！

The National Zoo's female panda gave birth to a live cub in 2005-and then again in 2013, 2015 and 2020.

国家动物园的雌性熊猫在2005年生下了一只活幼崽，然后在2013年、2015年和2020年又生了。
