## Paragraph Summarize

So the biggest weather and climate stories this year are a lot of what we've seen in recent years: hurricanes, floods, record heat.

今年最大的天气和气候事件与我们近年来看到的很多情况类似：飓风、洪水、创纪录的高温。

Hurricanes were a big story, especially in the U.S. this year.

飓风是一个大事件，尤其今年在美国。

We had several really devastating ones and really surprising ones, kicking off with Hurricane Beryl, which was the earliest Category 5 on record for the Atlantic Ocean, and it really rapidly intensified, and meteorologists were just sort of left with their mouths hanging open watching this storm develop.

我们经历了几次具有破坏性和令人惊讶的飓风，首先是飓风贝里尔，它是大西洋有记录以来最早的五级飓风，而且强度迅速增强，气象学家们只能眼睁睁地看着这场风暴的发展。

We had two really devastating hurricanes.

我们也遭遇了两场极具破坏性的飓风。

Incredible hurricane.It has dropped -it has dropped 50 millibars in 10 hours. I apologize.This is just horrific.

难以置信的飓风。它在10小时内下降了50毫巴。我道歉。这太可怕了。

Hurricane Milton and then particularly Hurricane Helene, which dropped tons of rain on western North Carolina and wreaked absolute devastation there.

先是飓风米尔顿，然后是飓风海伦，它们给北卡罗来纳州西部带来了大量降水，并在那里造成了巨大的破坏。

But it wasn't just the U.S. that was hit by these storms.

但受到这些风暴袭击的不仅仅是美国。

The Philippines actually had five typhoons, which are the same type of storm as a hurricane; it's just called a different name in the Pacific than it is in the Atlantic.

菲律宾遭遇了五个台风，台风和飓风是同一种风暴；只是在太平洋上的称呼和在大西洋上的称呼不同。

So they had five typhoons and a tropical storm, all within a month, which is a lot of storms.

他们在一个月内遭遇了五次台风和一次热带风暴，而这是很多的风暴。

And that wreaked a lot of devastation and killed a lot of people there.

造成了巨大的破坏，导致了很多人死亡。

Besides those sort of big storms we had a number of heat waves, which is just something that is incredibly connected to climate change and is one of the easiest weather events to see the imprint of climate change in and is something we just see more of every year.

除了那些大风暴，我们还经历了一些热浪，热浪与气候变化有着难以置信的联系，也是最容易看到气候变化痕迹的天气事件之一，而且我们每年看到的热浪越来越多。

They last longer, they are hotter, and they happen more frequently than they have in the past.

它们持续的时间更长，变得更热，而且发生的更频繁。

And one of the notable ones this year was in the Southwest U.S. ...

今年值得注意的一个热浪是在美国西南部……

"A dangerous heat wave is threatening more than 30 million people across the Southwest this morning."

“今天早上，一场危险的热浪正在威胁着西南部超过3000万人。”

Which has sort of been a focal point for these year after year.

这已经成为了这些年的一个焦点。

But Phoenix in particular had 113 consecutive days with high temperatures of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (nearly 38 degrees Celsius) or higher.

尤其是菲尼克斯，经历了连续113天的高温天气，气温达到或超过100华氏度（约38摄氏度）。

The previous record was 76 days in 1993. So that is a substantial increase on that.

此前的纪录是1993年的76天。所以这是一个相当大的增长。

And so that heat caused hundreds of deaths just in Phoenix alone.

仅在菲尼克斯，高温就造成了数百人死亡。

So when you consider that those heat waves were over a broader area, you know, you're looking at much higher numbers.

因此，当你考虑到那些热浪覆盖的区域更广时，你要知道，你看到的数字要高得多。

Of course, that wasn't the only place that saw heat.

当然，菲尼克斯并不是唯一出现高温的地方。

There were also really terrible spring heat waves across a large swath of Asia, from the Palestinian territories to India, Thailand and the Philippines.

在亚洲的大片地区，从巴勒斯坦到印度、泰国和菲律宾，也出现了非常可怕的春季热浪。

There were also huge floods.

今年也有洪灾。

"In Spain, where crews are searching for bodies in abandoned cars and swamped buildings after devastating flash floods."

在西班牙，工作人员正在被洪水淹没的废弃汽车和建筑物中搜寻尸体，此前该国遭遇了毁灭性的山洪暴发。

Spain was one of the sort of hallmark events this year because it was, I think, very surprising to people there; they weren't expecting it.

西班牙洪灾是今年的标志性事件之一，因为那里的人们对此感到非常惊讶；他们没有预料到会遭受洪灾。

That caused a huge amount of devastation and death.

洪灾造成了大量的区域破坏和人口死亡。

There are also really major floods in parts of Africa-Sudan, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad-and all of these also have some fingerprints of climate change on them.

非洲部分地区也发生了非常严重的洪水——苏丹、尼日利亚、喀麦隆、乍得——所有这些地区也都有一些气候变化的痕迹。

So probably the biggest climate story this year is that it's going to be the hottest year on record, which we know before it's even technically over.

因此，今年最大的气候新闻可能是，今年将是有记录以来最热的一年，甚至在今年结束之前我们就已经知道了。

We really knew this, honestly, at the end of October, just based on how hot all of the months of the year so far had been.

仅根据今年到目前为止各月份的气温情况，说实话，我们在十月底就知道了这一点。

And it's going to surpass the record just set last year, which itself was record hot by a record margin.

而且它将超过去年刚刚创下的纪录，而去年的纪录本身就已经是创纪录的高温了。

So 2024 is even hotter than 2023, and that is also one of the hallmarks of climate change: that we see record-hot years increasingly happen.

因此，2024年比2023年还热，这也是气候变化的标志之一：我们看到创纪录的高温年份越来越频繁地发生。

In fact, all of the hottest 10 years on record have been in the 21st century, and it's probably not going to be long before the 2024 record falls.

事实上，有记录以来最热的10年都在21世纪，而且可能用不了多久，2024年的记录就会被打破。

You know, if I could pick just a couple words or phrases to describe 2024, it would be "record-hot" and "extreme."

如果我用几个词或短语来描述2024年，那就是“创纪录的高温”和“极端”。

And I feel like those are probably the words I would have picked in a lot of other years, too, but it's just-that fact is a sign that climate change is here and it's happening now.

我觉得这可能也是我在其他年份会选择的词语，但事实是，气候变化已经发生，而且正在发生。

It's not a future problem, as I think we thought about it as, you know, a couple decades ago; we're living it right now, and every year really bears that out.

这不是一个未来的问题，因为我们几十年前就已经思考过这个问题了；我们现在就生活在其中，而且每年都在证明这一点。
