## Paragraph Summarize

here

---

So we have this message that marriage is supposed to be the most important relationship in your life, supposed to be your best friend, and so on.

我们传达的信息是，婚姻应该是你生命中最重要的关系，应该是你最好的朋友，等等。

But there's a disconnect with the reality, which is that marriage rates have plummeted, and for those who do get married, they're likely to get married much later than they were several decades ago.

但现实情况却与此脱节，即结婚率大幅下降，而对于那些已婚人士来说，他们结婚的时间可能比几十年前要晚得多。

And this has opened up, I think, a lot of space and an appetite for people to figure out: "What do alternatives look like? Is there really only one path to having a fulfilled life?"

我认为这为人们提供了很大的空间和兴趣去弄清楚：“替代方案是什么样的？通往充实生活的道路真的只有一条吗？”

And that's where, I think, you're seeing some of this innovation and thinking more expansively about friendship coming from.

我认为，这就是你看到一些创新并更广泛地思考友谊的原因。

There's an appetite for more creativity, to know that there's more than one option, whether because you never get married,

人们渴望更多的创造力，知道有不止一种选择，无论是因为你从未结婚，

or you have a romantic relationship and you survive your spouse, or the relationship ends, and knowing that there are other ways to find these really core needs.

还是你有一段恋爱关系并且你比配偶活得长，或者这段关系结束了，并且知道还有其他方法可以找到这些真正核心的需求。

And based on the research you did for your book, how do you think that this de-emphasis on friendship hurts us as individuals and, you know, maybe even hurts our marriages and other romantic partnerships as well?

根据您为这本书所做的研究，您认为这种对友谊的淡化会对我们个人造成怎样的伤害，甚至对我们的婚姻和其他恋爱关系带来什么影响？

By expecting so much of marriage and so little of friendship, we end up undermining our romantic relationships, kind of setting them up to fail,

由于对婚姻期望过高而对友谊期望过低，我们最终会破坏恋爱关系，导致恋爱关系失败，

and we diminish and weaken our friendships by expecting so little of them and not really investing in them.

而我们对友谊的期望过低，并没有真正投入其中，从而削弱了我们的友谊。

And on the romantic relationship front, there's research looking at how people who, in a sense, diversify their emotional portfolio-as in have more than one close person that they can turn to if something, you know, serious or significant happens-

在恋爱关系方面，有研究调查了那些在某种意义上分散情感的人（即在发生严重或重大事件时可以求助于多个亲密的人），

that they are happier, have more stable marriages, more satisfying marriages than people who really always go, first and foremost, to their spouse.

他们比那些总是首先求助于配偶的人更幸福，婚姻更稳定，更令人满意。

I like to think of it as the model of a kind of big-box store, is what people have in mind: you get everything in one place, and it's really efficient.

我喜欢把它看作是一种大型商店的模型，这是人们心中的想法：你可以在一个地方买到所有东西，而且非常高效。

But we also know that there are consequences when big-box stores enter, you know, enter communities and that sometimes doing something that's,

但我们也知道，当大型商店进入社区时，会产生一些后果，有时做一些事情，

like, not all in one place or getting everything in one aisle can have some other benefits, and I think that that's certainly the case for having not just your spouse,

比如，不把所有东西都放在一个地方，或者把所有东西都放在一个过道，可能会带来其他好处，我认为这当然适用于不仅拥有你的配偶，

who is your best friend and your confidant and your career coach and your roommate and your, you know, co-parent, and so on, but having other people that you really care about.

也就是你最好的朋友、你的知己、你的职业教练、你的室友、你的共同抚养人等等，还拥有你真正关心的其他人。

And just for the flip side of friendship, if you don't think it's an important relationship or it's going to be there in the long haul,

就友谊的另一面而言，如果你认为它不是一种重要的关系，或者它不会长期存在，

then you're probably, you know, going to make that a self-fulfilling prophecy and not think about the ways that a friendship can be more enduring or be more central to your life.

那么你可能会把它变成一个自我实现的预言，而不会去思考友谊如何能更持久或在你的生活中占据更重要的地位。

What other research did you find that looked into the importance of these non-romantic friendships and partnerships?

你还发现了哪些研究这些非恋爱友谊和伙伴关系的重要性？

The research on friendship is not, like, the best research. You know, there's not, I think, particularly on adult friendship, the most robust work on this.

这项关于友谊的研究并不是最好的研究。我认为，特别是关于成人友谊的研究，在这方面还没有最深入的研究。

And I've talked to researchers and they have very much admitted this, and I think part of it is: it is harder to study when it's not a kind of clear dyadic relationship in the way that you would with a spouse.

我和研究人员谈过，他们非常承认这一点，我认为部分原因是：当友谊不像你和配偶那样是一种明确的二元关系时，研究起来会更困难。

So the research that I look at ends up being more around surveys-so asking people about the number of close friends in their lives or, you know,

我的研究最终更多地是围绕调查展开的——询问人们他们生活中有多少亲密的朋友，

"If something difficult happens, who is the first person that you're going to reach out to?"

或者“如果遇到困难，你会第一个联系谁？”

And we've seen that, over just a number of decades, that Americans report having fewer close friends than they had previously.

我们发现，在过去的几十年里，美国人报告的亲密朋友比以前少了。

One researcher has called this a "friendship recession" and has done follow-up research that's really shown that there's a class difference:

一位研究人员将此称为“友谊衰退”，并进行了后续研究，结果确实表明存在阶级差异：

that people who are less educated are even less likely to have a robust circle of friends and less likely to have the kind of spaces-community spaces where they can go to and cultivate these friendships.

受教育程度较低的人更不可能拥有一个强大的朋友圈，也更不可能拥有可以去培养这些友谊的社区空间。

It just would have been the case that a few decades ago people would've had multiple close people to turn to and that that's become a lot less common and it's become far more common for people to have no friends at all.

几十年前，人们会向多个亲密的人求助，但这种情况已经变得不那么常见了，人们根本没有朋友的情况也变得越来越普遍。

To the question of, "Who do people turn to first with a personal problem?" In 1990 [more than] a quarter of people said a friend, and now that's only 16 percent and more than half say their spouse.

对于“人们遇到个人问题时首先向谁求助？”这个问题，1990 年，[超过]四分之一的人说是朋友，而现在只有16%，超过一半的人说是配偶。

So there really is this kind of shift that's happened where people have diverted activities or kind of devotion that they would have given to friends to spouses instead. Right.

确实发生了这种转变，人们将他们本应该给予朋友的活动或奉献转移到配偶身上。是的。

There's a gender divide on this, too, which might not be so surprising-I think there's growing recognition that

在这方面也存在性别差异，这可能并不奇怪——我认为人们越来越认识到，

American men are having a harder time cultivating deep friendships than women are, and you can see this in, also, how men and women behave in their friendships.

美国男性比女性更难培养深厚的友谊，你也可以从男女在友谊中的表现中看到这一点。

So, you know, within the last week about half of women have told their friends that they love them, and that's a quarter of men-so, you know, much lower rate.

在过去一周内，大约有一半的女性告诉她们的朋友，她们爱她们，而男性只有四分之一——比例要低得多。

There have been researchers who've asked questions like, "Have you had a private conversation with a friend in the last week where you've shared personal feelings?"

有研究人员问过这样的问题：“在过去一周内，你和朋友私下交谈过，分享过个人感受吗？”

And the answer is about half for women and about a third for men, so the kind of emotional intimacy that women are more likely to have in their friendships, we're seeing less so in men's friendships.

答案是，女性约占一半，男性约占三分之一，所以女性在友谊中更有可能拥有的那种情感亲密，在男性的友谊中却很少见。
