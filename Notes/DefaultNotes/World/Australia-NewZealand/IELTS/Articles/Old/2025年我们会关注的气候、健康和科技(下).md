## Paragraph Summarize

The focus of 2024 in AI has definitely been on generative AI because the biggest developments this year were often in the new forms of what it could make.

2024年人工智能的焦点肯定是生成式人工智能，因为今年最大的发展就是它能创造的新形式。

When ChatGPT was unveiled in 2022 we saw it make text, but now generative AI is making really convincing audio.

当ChatGPT在2022年推出时，我们看到它可以生成文本，但现在生成式人工智能可以制作出非常令人信服的音频。

I watched a demo of a ChatGPT-based voice where the user asked it to count to 30 really fast and then it paused to catch its breath in the middle of counting.

我观看了一个基于ChatGPT的语音演示，用户要求它快速数到30，然后它在计数过程中停下来喘了口气。

So the folks who are developing these generative systems are really looking to: How do they sound human, and, and how do they feel authentic?

因此，开发这些生成系统的人真正关注的是：它们听起来如何更像人类，以及如何让人感觉更真实？

So there've definitely been improvements to audio.

当然，音频方面肯定已经有了改进。

If I could describe 2024 in three words, I would say "boom." We're definitely in an AI boom.

如果我用三个词来描述2024年，我会说“繁荣”。我们无疑正处于人工智能的繁荣时期。

I think this really was the year that AI started showing up on our phones, started showing up on our computers, started showing up in our workplaces in more obvious ways than maybe we had been familiar with before.

我认为今年是人工智能开始出现在我们的手机上、电脑上、工作场所中的一年，而且出现的方式比我们以前所熟悉的更加明显。

There have been huge investments in AI and continued investments in generative AI.

人们在人工智能方面投入了巨额资金，并且在生成式人工智能方面也持续进行投资。

We saw Open AI make plans to move from a nonprofit to a profit.

我们看到Open AI制定了从非营利组织向营利组织转变的计划。

We saw Elon Musk break up with Open AI and roll out his competitor, Grok, on X, formerly Twitter.

我们看到埃隆·马斯克与Open AI分道扬镳，并在X（前身为Twitter）上推出了它的竞争对手Grok。

The next word I would pick, I think, as a consequence of that boom is "slop."

接下来我要选的词，我想，是繁荣带来的结果，那就是“泔水”。

"Slop" was a contender for Oxford's word of the year; it lost out to "brain rot."

“泔水” 曾是牛津年度词汇的竞争者；它输给了 “脑腐化”。

But "slop" means this AI equivalent of spam.

但是，“泔水”指的是相当于垃圾邮件的人工智能。

So if you were on Facebook at all earlier this year, maybe you encountered something like "Shrimp Jesus," which was this phenomenon where people were using chatbots to make these bizarre chimeras of religious figures and crustaceans, or these clearly AI-made images of structures built out of Coca-Cola bottles, and it's really-was just engagement bait.

如果你今年早些时候浏览过Facebook，也许你会遇到类似“虾耶稣”的东西，这是人们使用聊天机器人制作出的宗教人物和甲壳类动物的怪异嵌合体，或者一些明显是由人工智能生成的，用可口可乐瓶建造的结构图像，只是吸引用户参与的诱饵。

I'll take a slightly more optimistic note with the third word and I'll say "promise."

我会用第三个词来表达一个稍微乐观的观点，我会选择“希望”。

I mean, we saw some clever and what I would consider good uses of AI in terms of pattern recognition, of using AI to help decipher a scroll that was burned by the Pompeii volcano from hundreds and hundreds of years ago, to AI helping in drug development for looking for novel forms of antibiotics.

我的意思是，我们看到了一些巧妙的，很棒的人工智能应用，比如模式识别，比如用人工智能来帮助解读几百上千年前被庞贝火山烧毁的卷轴，以及用人工智能在药物研发方面寻找新型抗生素。

So there definitely is something here to AI.

因此，人工智能肯定具有一定的作用。

I don't want to be too cynical here; I think it's good to be critical, but this definitely is a technology that has promise.

我不想在这里过于愤世嫉俗；我认为保持批判性是好的，但这绝对是一项有前途的技术。

In 2025 I think we're going to see more about the hunger for water and energy and resources that generative AI needs, especially for the large data centers required to operate it.

我认为，到 2025 年，我们将会看到生成式人工智能对水、能源和资源的需求更加迫切，尤其是运行生成式人工智能所需的大型数据中心。

We know that Microsoft is looking at reviving, for instance, one of the mothballed reactors at Three Mile Island, the nuclear power plant, to power its data centers.

例如，微软正在考虑重启三里岛核电站的其中一个被封存的反应堆，来为其数据中心供电。

There's been more attention paid to what's called "Data Center Alley" in the mid-Atlantic.

而在大西洋中部地区所谓的“数据中心巷”，也受到了更多的关注。

In terms of keeping these data centers active, that requires fossil-fuel plants.

就保持这些数据中心的活跃而言，这需要化石燃料工厂。

I also think we're gonna start to see more forms of generative AI-so that's AI based on LLM-type style models-that aren't quite like the chatbots we're familiar with.

我还认为，我们将开始看到更多形式的生成式人工智能——即基于大语言模型类型风格的人工智能——它们与我们熟悉的聊天机器人不太一样。

I'm thinking specifically, as an example, what are called AI agents.

例如所谓的人工智能代理。

So these are systems that you would access on your phone or computer like you would a chatbot, but it's got more autonomy to do things.

你可以在手机或电脑上使用它，就像使用聊天机器人一样，但它有更多的自主性来做事。

So one common example of what an AI agent might do is help book you a plane ticket.

一个常见例子是，人工智能代理能帮助你预订机票。

And you might tell it-or it might know because it's been analyzing your personal data-that, you know, you prefer aisle seats, so it will look for aisle seats for you and, and book an aisle seat.

你可能会告诉它——或者它可能知道，因为它一直在分析你的个人数据——你更喜欢靠过道的座位，所以它会为你寻找靠过道的座位，并预订一个靠过道的座位。

And these agents, in theory, have more autonomy to interact with other apps, and they don't require the hand-holding or the prompting that something like ChatGPT needs now.

并且理论上，这些人工智能代理，有更多的自主性与其他应用程序进行交互，并且不需要像ChatGPT现在需要的那种手把手的指导或提示。

So if you've used ChatGPT with any regularity, you might know that it might take multiple prompts to get it to produce the thing that you're looking for.

如果你经常使用ChatGPT，你可能知道需要多次提示才能让它生成你正在寻找的东西。

With-the idea behind an AI agent is that you tell it what to do and, and it goes off and it interfaces with other apps, and you don't need to keep nudging it along.

而人工智能代理背后的理念是，你只需告诉它要做什么，它就会去与其他应用程序交互，你不需要一直推动它。
