23 hours ago

For many teens, Saturday mornings are a time to snooze. After a week of getting up early, the weekend brings a chance to catch up on much-needed slumber. And sleeping in on the weekend may reduce anxiety, a new study finds — as long as teens don’t tack on more than two extra hours of shut-eye.

It might seem like a good idea to get as much sleep as possible on the weekend. Sleep is [essential for a fully functioning brain and body](https://www.snexplores.org/article/lets-learn-about-sleep) — especially for adolescents. And 75 percent of American teens don’t get the recommended eight to 10 hours per night. School, homework and other weekday activities require them to rise early. Teens’ [circadian rhythm](https://www.snexplores.org/article/scientists-say-circadian) also makes it difficult to fall asleep before 11 p.m.

Yet past research has hinted that too much sleep on the weekend [can lead to health issues](https://www.snexplores.org/article/sleeping-in-weekends-not-effective-recovery-health). Those studies had found a possible connection between catch-up sleep and depression. But the link hadn’t been carefully studied. What’s more, no one had looked at another major aspect of mental health — anxiety — in relation to sleep.

That got Sojeong Kim curious. Kim is a graduate student in clinical psychology at the University of Oregon in Eugene. She set out to investigate how catch-up sleep might be related to anxiety.

## Finding the sweet spot

Kim used data from the [Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study](https://abcdstudy.org/). This study has  been following thousands of kids and teens from across the United States to learn how their brains develop over time.

For her study, Kim focused on data collected from teens when they were 12 to 15 years old. That’s around the age that people start having trouble getting enough sleep, she explains. It’s “harder for teens to fall asleep early and wake up in the morning.”

The data included sleep and activity patterns for nearly 1,900 young people. These data came from a Fitbit each participant wore during the study. Participants had also filled out questionnaires about their feelings of anxiety and depression. Kim studied those, too.

#### [Let’s learn about sleep](https://www.snexplores.org/article/lets-learn-about-sleep)

Teens who slept in on weekends reported the lowest symptoms of [anxiety](https://www.snexplores.org/article/scientists-say-anxiety-definition-pronunciation), but only if they got less than two hours of extra shut-eye. Teens who didn’t sleep in — or lost sleep on the weekend — reported higher anxiety levels. Those who slept more than two additional hours had the highest anxiety symptoms of all.

Anxious teens experienced neck tension — a common sign of stress. They also reported excessive worries, fears and guilt.

Kim shared her findings at the SLEEP 2025 conference in Seattle, Wash., on June 11.

“The results show a possible link between sleeping a little more on weekends and feeling less anxious,” says Christopher Depner. “But we still need more research to know for sure.” Depner, who was not involved in the work, studies sleep and circadian rhythms at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.

One limit of the new research is that it was an observational study, Depner says. An observational study is one where researchers simply observe something happening in the world. They don’t set up an experiment and control variables to test a [hypothesis](https://www.snexplores.org/article/scientists-say-hypothesis) about how it works.

“The scientists just watched how people sleep without asking them to try any new sleep habits or treatments,” Depner points out. Having people follow different sleep schedules and then measuring their mental health could help clarify how one affects the other.

## Preventing social jet lag

If there is a link between just the right amount of catch-up sleep and anxiety — why? What would make someone who gets more than two hours of extra sleep more anxious?

Kim suspects that having big swings between weekday and weekend sleep schedules creates what scientists call _social jet lag_.

#### [Explainer: What is anxiety?](https://www.snexplores.org/article/explainer-what-anxiety)

Like jet lag triggered by traveling between time zones, social jet lag causes <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">grogginess</span> and a foggy brain. It happens when [our body’s clock](https://www.snexplores.org/article/explainer-our-bodies-internal-clocks) is out of sync with our sleep cycle. Switching from too little sleep to too much is a known trigger. Although Kim’s study didn’t investigate this as a cause, she suspects it’s part of the problem.

Kim didn’t find a clear link between catch-up sleep and symptoms of depression. That might be due to the age group Kim studied. “Usually, depressive symptoms onset later in adolescence,” she says. Anxiety, on the other hand, tends to start when teens are younger. Kim’s next step is to study weekend catch-up sleep among older teens.

For now, she wants teens to know there can be benefits to catch-up sleep. “Getting a little extra sleep on weekends might help [you] feel less anxious,” she says. “But not too much, because it can give you the opposite effect.”

**adolescent**: Someone in that transitional stage of physical and psychological development that begins at the onset of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">puberty</span>, typically between the ages of 11 and 13, and ends with adulthood.

**anxiety**: A nervous reaction to events causing excessive uneasiness and apprehension. People with anxiety may even develop panic attacks.

**anxious**: (n. anxiety) A feeling of dread over some potential or upcoming situation, usually one over which someone feels they have little control.

**circadian rhythm**: Biological functions such as body temperature and sleeping/waking times that operate on a roughly 24-hour cycle.

**clinical**: (in medicine) A term that refers to diagnoses, treatments or experiments involving people.

**cognitive**: A term that relates to mental activities, such as thinking, learning, remembering and solving puzzles.

**control**: (n.) A part of an experiment where there is no change from normal conditions. The control is essential to scientific experiments. It shows that any new effect is likely due only to the part of the test that a researcher has altered. For example, if scientists were testing different types of fertilizer in a garden, they would want one section of it to remain unfertilized, as the control. Its area would show how plants in this garden grow under normal conditions. And that gives scientists something against which they can compare their experimental data. (v.) To include some unchanged or unaffected conditions in an experiment so their results could later be contrasted with those from where changes had been made.

**depression**: (in medicine) A mental illness characterized by persistent sadness and apathy. Although these feelings can be triggered by events, such as the death of a loved one or the move to a new city, that isn’t typically considered an “illness” — unless the symptoms are prolonged and harm an individual’s ability to perform normal daily tasks (such as working, sleeping or interacting with others). People suffering from depression often feel they lack the energy needed to get anything done. They may have difficulty concentrating on things or showing an interest in normal events. Many times, these feelings seem to be triggered by nothing; they can appear out of nowhere.

**graduate student**: Someone working toward an advanced degree by taking classes and performing research. This work is done after the student has already graduated from college (usually with a four-year degree).

**hypothesis**: (v. hypothesize) A proposed explanation for a phenomenon. In science, a hypothesis is an idea that must be rigorously tested before it is accepted or rejected.

**jet lag**: A temporary disruption of bodily rhythms caused when someone travels across several time zones in a matter of hours.

**mental health**: A term for someone’s emotional, psychological and social well-being. It refers to how people behave on their own and how they interact with others. It includes how people make choices, handle stress and manage fear or anxiety. Poor mental health can be triggered by disease or might reflect a short-term response to life’s challenges. It can occur in people of any age, from babies to the elderly.

**psychology**: (adj. psychological ) The study of the human mind, especially in relation to actions and behavior. To do this, some perform research using animals. Scientists and mental-health professionals who work in this field are known as psychologists.

**questionnaire**: A list of identical questions administered to a group of people to collect related information on each of them. The questions may be delivered by voice, online or in writing. Questionnaires may elicit opinions, health information (like sleep times, weight or items in the last day’s meals), descriptions of daily habits (how much exercise you get or how much TV do you watch) and demographic data (such as age, ethnic background, income and political affiliation).

**social**: (adj.) Relating to gatherings of people; a term for animals (or people) that prefer to exist in groups. (noun) A gathering of people, for instance those who belong to a club or other organization, for the purpose of enjoying each other’s company.

**stress**: (in psychology) A mental, physical, emotional or behavioral reaction to an event or circumstance (stressor) that disturbs a person or animal’s usual state of being or places increased demands on a person or animal; psychological stress can be either positive or negative.

**symptom**: A physical or mental indicator generally regarded to be characteristic of a disease. Sometimes a single symptom — especially a general one, such as fever or pain — can be a sign of any of many different types of injury or disease.

**variable**: (in experiments) A factor that can be changed, especially one allowed to change in a scientific experiment. For instance, when researchers measure how much insecticide it might take to kill a fly, they might change the dose or the age at which the insect is exposed. Both the dose and age would be variables in this experiment.
