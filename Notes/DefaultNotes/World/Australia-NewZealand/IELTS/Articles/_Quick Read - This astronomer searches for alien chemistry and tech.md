One of the main ways that scientists look for extraterrestrial life is by detecting radio waves. When people hear this, they often think it involves snooping on aliens, says Chenoa Tremblay. “That’s not what we’re doing. We’re not trying to eavesdrop or invade anybody’s privacy.” Instead, Tremblay uses radio [telescopes](https://www.snexplores.org/article/scientists-say-telescope) to study [molecules](https://www.snexplores.org/article/scientists-say-molecule) in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">the gas layers</span> around stars. A radio astronomer, she works for the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif.

Tremblay relies on a technique called <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spectroscopy</span>. When different molecules interact with energy from nearby stars, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">the molecules absorb and re-emit that energy in specific frequencies.</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">“Every molecule has its own fingerprint,”</span> she says. Some, such as water and methane, act as biosignatures. These are signs that life may be producing these molecules on [exoplanets](https://www.snexplores.org/article/scientists-say-exoplanet).

Tremblay uses the [Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array telescope](http://In%20The%20Incredibles,%20Violet%20Parr%20is%20a%20lot%20like%20other%20teenagers.%20She%20has%20embarrassing%20parents,%20a%20troublesome%20little%20brother%20and%20a%20crush%20so%20intense%20it%20makes%20her%20want%20to%20disappear.%20But%20unlike%20other%20teens,%20Violet%20can%20turn%20invisible.%20So%20she%20can%20actually%20vanish%20when%20the%20boy%20she%20likes%20looks%20her%20way.%20%20Characters%20with%20invisibility%20powers%20%E2%80%94%20like%20Violet,%20the%20Fantastic%20Four's%20Invisible%20Woman%20and%20H.G.%20Wells%E2%80%99%20Invisible%20Man%20%E2%80%94%20can%20do%20all%20sorts%20of%20cool%20things.%20Escape%20embarrassing%20situations.%20Snoop%20on%20other%20people.%20Get%20into%20places%20where%20they're%20not%20allowed.%20It%E2%80%99s%20no%20wonder%20why%20invisibility%20is%20one%20of%20the%20powers%20people%20most%20wish%20for.%20Many%20animals,%20too,%20find%20it%20helpful%20to%20hide%20in%20plain%20sight.%20And%20though%20it%E2%80%99s%20out%20of%20reach%20for%20people,%20some%20animals%20are%20nearly%20transparent.%20%20%20%20Being%20invisible%20is%20useful%20for%20animals%20that%20spend%20a%20lot%20of%20time%20in%20places%20with%20no%20good%20hiding%20spots,%20like%20the%20air%20or%20open%20ocean,%20says%20Kate%20Feller.%20She%20is%20a%20visual%20ecologist%20at%20Union%20College%20in%20Schenectady,%20N.Y.%20%20%20The%20secret%20to%20invisibility%20is%20all%20about%20light.%20%E2%80%9CThe%20way%20we%20see%20things%20is%20when%20light%20is%20reflected%20back%20off%20of%20an%20object%20onto%20our%20eyes,%E2%80%9D%20says%20Feller.%20The%20more%20light%20that%20can%20pass%20through%20something%20undisturbed,%20the%20harder%20it%20is%20to%20see%20that%20thing.%20%20%20Light%20can%E2%80%99t%20easily%20pass%20through%20most%20animals,%20Feller%20says.%20Light%20that%20hits%20our%20bodies%20usually%20gets%20absorbed%20or%20bounced%20around.%20But%20animals%20with%20nearly%20invisible%20body%20parts%20have%20figured%20out%20tricks%20to%20get%20around%20this.%20%20%20Cutting%20out%20color%20%20A%20lot%20of%20animals%20get%20their%20colors%20from%20molecules%20called%20pigments.%20These%20compounds%20appear%20different%20colors%20depending%20on%20which%20wavelengths%20of%20light%20they%20absorb.%20Human%20hair%20and%20skin,%20for%20instance,%20get%20color%20from%20the%20pigment%20melanin.%20For%20an%20animal%20to%20vanish%20in%20plain%20sight,%20it%20needs%20to%20get%20rid%20of%20these%20colorful%20compounds.%20%20%20Most%20fish%20are%20born%20without%20pigments.%20This%20helps%20them%20hide%20from%20predators%20when%20they%20are%20too%20small%20to%20swim%20fast.%20They%20typically%20develop%20pigments%20as%20they%20grow%20up.%20Yet%20some%20species%20stay%20see-through%20their%20whole%20lives.%20One%20is%20the%20ghost%20catfish%20\(Kryptopterus%20vitreolus\).%20Its%20head%20has%20pigments,%20but%20its%20body%20is%20almost%20fully%20transparent.%20Seen%20from%20far%20away,%20it%20looks%20like%20a%20floating%20head!%20%20%20There%20are%20some%20body%20parts%20that%20always%20have%20pigments.%20Eyes%20need%20pigments%20to%20absorb%20light%20so%20an%20animal%20can%20see.%20And%20even%20clear%20stomachs%20will%20show%20up%20if%20animals%20eat%20colorful%20food.%20Ghost%20catfish%20%E2%80%9Chide%E2%80%9D%20their%20meals%20in%20a%20long,%20thin,%20tube-shaped%20stomach%20and%20eat%20only%20small%20bits%20of%20food,%20says%20Qibin%20Zhao.%20This%20physicist%20and%20material%20scientist%20studies%20ghost%20catfish%20at%20Shanghai%20Jiao%20Tong%20University%20in%20China.%20%20Blood%20can%E2%80%99t%20be%20transparent,%20either.%20The%20molecules%20that%20carry%20oxygen%20have%20colored%20compounds.%20\(The%20one%20in%20our%20blood,%20hemoglobin,%20makes%20it%20red.\)%20So%20up%20close,%20the%20ghost%20catfish%E2%80%99s%20vessels%20are%20still%20visible.%20%20%20Glass%20frogs%20have%20a%20clever%20way%20around%20this.%20When%20these%20mostly%20clear%20frogs%20sleep,%20they%20cram%20almost%2090%20percent%20of%20their%20blood%20cells%20into%20their%20liver.%20This%20makes%20their%20belly%20skin%20two%20to%20three%20times%20more%20transparent%20than%20it%20would%20otherwise%20be.%20Scientists%20think%20the%20frogs%20do%20this%20so%20that%20predators%20don%E2%80%99t%20snack%20on%20them%20while%20they%20nap.%20%20%20%20%20%20Stopping%20light%20from%20bouncing%20around%20%20Even%20pigment-free%20objects%20are%20not%20entirely%20invisible.%20Light%20travels%20at%20different%20speeds%20through%20different%20materials.%20As%20a%20result,%20light%20zipping%20through%20one%20material%20will%20bend%20or%20bounce%20when%20it%20hits%20another%20material.%20Light%20bouncing%20off%20an%20animal%20makes%20it%20shine,%20just%20like%20the%20sun%20reflecting%20off%20a%20puddle.%20%20%20Some%20animals%E2%80%99%20see-through%20parts%20are%20nearly%20reflection-free.%20Glasswing%20butterflies,%20for%20instance,%20have%20wings%20that%20are%20almost%20fully%20transparent.%20Their%20wings%20have%20fewer%20reflectiv

New Mexico to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pick up these signals</span>. “We [then] use computers to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">translate that information into images</span> using complex mathematics,” she says. That lets her team “study the universe in a way that we can’t use our eyes to do.” In this interview, Tremblay shares her experiences with _Science News Explores_. (This interview has been edited for content and readability.) 

## What inspired you to pursue your career? 

I grew up in a small town of about 600 people in New Hampshire. There wasn’t a lot of expectation of girls doing much outside of the home. But <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">I was a naturally very curious child. Throughout high school, I tried exploring subjects I liked.</span> In general, learning was hard for me most of the time. But <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">math</span> was always fairly easy for me, and I enjoyed <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">chemistry</span>.

I decided to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">study business and accounting in college</span>. It seemed logical, but I really wasn’t sure what I’d do with it. I ended up hating the coursework. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">My roommate was studying chemistry, and I found myself helping her with her homework.</span> My friends finally convinced me that I should study chemistry instead.

After earning my bachelor’s degree, I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">worked at various companies doing research for about 25 years.</span> That’s where I realized that I didn’t have to just study the chemistry of things here on Earth. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">I could study the chemistry of the universe.</span>

## How did you get to where you are today? 

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">I started volunteering for university projects to learn from mentors.</span> That helped me figure out how to become a radio astronomer. In 2016, I got into a doctoral program for physics and astronomy in Australia. In high school and my first years in college, I really struggled with physics. So it’s really funny that I ended up with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">a Ph.D. in the subject</span>. At some point in the learning process, things just started to click. 

During my program, I was using a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">brand-new radio telescope</span> in Western Australia. We used a set of [wavelength](https://www.snexplores.org/article/scientists-say-wavelength) ranges that we hadn’t used before. We found some molecules that are super important to the early stages of life. But these popped up in environments that wouldn’t necessarily indicate life, like around a newborn star. That suggested that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">these molecules do exist and could be available for life to develop elsewhere.</span>

#### [Understanding light and other forms of energy on the move](https://www.snexplores.org/article/understanding-light-and-other-forms-of-energy-on-the-move)

This is also when I started looking into technosignatures. These are signs of technology from far-off worlds. The techniques used to study the chemistry of space are very similar to those used to study whether technology exists beyond Earth. We can look for both in the same data set by analyzing them in slightly different ways. So, I ended up using the telescope data to study both. 

After finishing my Ph.D., I continued some of that work on a different telescope, the [Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder](https://www.skao.int/en/explore/telescopes) in Western Australia. I then moved back to New Mexico to develop a brand-new computer system on the Very Large Array. It’s an iconic telescope that has appeared in different movies and TV shows.

Right now, we’re using it to conduct one of the largest surveys for technosignatures ever. That’s because we no longer have to dedicate time to using the telescope ourselves. Instead, we rely on <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">commensal observations</span>. That’s when we receive a copy of the data from other projects using the telescope. Every time the telescope’s on, we get to use the data to search for technosignatures.

These antennae are part of the Murchison Widefield Array in western Australia. Radio telescopes like this one detect radio waves through antennae tuned to specific frequencies.Robert Hollow

## What has you excited about your field right now? 

I’d say being able to build these commensal systems and sharing data. We need to spend as much time looking at as much of the sky as possible. That involves using as many wavelengths as we can. Even if a civilization is sending out a bright signal, we can’t expect that beacon to be on all the time.

Our galaxy alone is huge. If we had to take our turn on telescopes all the time, it might take up to 60 years to observe every star once. And that might be something like every star within 100 [light-years](https://www.snexplores.org/article/scientist-say-light-year) of us (about 60,000 stars). 

We are using the Very Large Array telescope in New Mexico and the [MeerKAT telescope](https://www.sarao.ac.za/science/meerkat/about-meerkat/) in South Africa for these commensal programs. These two let us look at both the northern and southern hemispheres, as well as a little bit of overlapping sky. This gives us one of the broadest views that we’ve ever accomplished in trying to find our place in the universe. 

## What piece of advice do you wish you’d been given when you were younger? 

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">The career you decide on now doesn’t have to be what you do later. You can change your mind and switch paths.</span> My parents’ generation expected that you stay at the same job until you retire. There wasn’t this understanding that you could switch careers if you were unhappy.

You also don’t have to know what you want to do from a young age. My siblings knew since they were little what exactly they wanted to do. I sometimes feel like I’m still not 100 percent sure what I want to do. And that’s okay, too. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">You can explore what you find interesting about the world. </span>

### Power Words

[More About Power Words](https://www.snexplores.org/power-words-aid-stem-literacy/)

**algorithm**: A group of rules or procedures for solving a problem in a series of steps. Algorithms are used in mathematics and in computer programs for figuring out solutions. 

**alien**: A non-native organism. (in astronomy) Life on or from a distant world. 

**array**: A broad and organized group of objects. Sometimes they are instruments placed in a systematic fashion to collect information in a coordinated way. Other times, an array can refer to things that are laid out or displayed in a way that can make a broad range of related things, such as colors, visible at once. The term can even apply to a range of options or choices. 

**astronomer**: A scientist who works in the field of research that deals with celestial objects, space and the physical universe. 

**astronomy**: The area of science that deals with celestial objects, space and the physical universe. People who work in this field are called astronomers. 

**chemistry**: The field of science that deals with the composition, structure and properties of substances and how they interact. Scientists use this knowledge to study unfamiliar substances, to reproduce large quantities of useful substances or to design and create new and useful substances. (about compounds) Chemistry also is used as a term to refer to the recipe of a compound, the way it’s produced or some of its properties. People who work in this field are known as chemists. 

**data**: Facts and/or statistics collected together for analysis but not necessarily organized in a way that gives them meaning. For digital information (the type stored by computers), those data typically are numbers stored in a binary code, portrayed as strings of zeros and ones.

It is the opposite of an artificial setting, such as a research laboratory. 

**galaxy**: A group of stars — and usually invisible, mysterious dark matter — all held together by gravity. Giant galaxies, such as the Milky Way, often have more than 100 billion stars. The dimmest galaxies may have just a few thousand. Some galaxies also have gas and dust from which they make new stars. 

**generation**: A group of individuals (in any species) born at about the same time or that are regarded as a single group. Your parents belong to one generation of your family, for example, and your grandparents to another. Similarly, you and everyone within a few years of your age across the planet are referred to as belonging to a particular generation of humans. The term also is sometimes extended to year classes of other animals or to types of  inanimate objects (such as electronics or automobiles). 

**high school**: A designation for grades nine through 12 in the U.S. system of compulsory public education. High-school graduates may apply to colleges for further, advanced education. 

**information**: (as opposed to data) Facts provided or trends learned about something or someone, often as a result of studying data. 

**mentor**: An individual who lends his or her experience to advise someone starting out in a field. In science, teachers or researchers often mentor students or younger scientists by helping them to refine their research questions. Mentors also can offer feedback on how young investigators prepare to conduct research or interpret their data. 

**methane**: A hydrocarbon with the chemical formula CH4 (meaning there are four hydrogen atoms bound to one carbon atom). It’s a natural constituent of what’s known as natural gas. It’s also emitted by decomposing plant material in wetlands and is belched out by cows and other ruminant livestock. From a climate perspective, methane is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide is in trapping heat in Earth’s atmosphere, making it a very important greenhouse gas. 

**molecule**: A group of atoms that represents the smallest possible amount of a chemical compound. Molecules can be made of single types of atoms or of different types. For example, the oxygen in air is made of two bound oxygen atoms (O2). Water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H2O). 

**physics**: The scientific study of the nature and properties of matter and energy. Classical physics is an explanation of the nature and properties of matter and energy that relies on descriptions such as Newton’s laws of motion. Quantum physics, a field of study that emerged later, is a more accurate way of explaining the motions and behavior of matter. A scientist who works in such areas is known as a physicist. 

**radio**: Referring to radio waves, or the device that receives these transmissions. Radio waves are a part of the electromagnetic <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spectrum</span> that people often use for long-distance communication. Longer than the waves of visible light, radio waves are used to transmit radio and television signals. They also are used in radar. Many astronomical objects also radiate some of their energy as radio waves. 

**radio waves**: Waves in a part of the electromagnetic spectrum. They are a type that people now use for long-distance communication. Longer than the waves of visible light, radio waves are used to transmit radio and television signals. They also are used in radar. 

**range**: The full extent or distribution of something. For instance, a plant or animal’s range is the area over which it naturally exists. (in math or for measurements) The extent to which values can vary (such as the highest to lowest temperatures). Also, the distance within which something can be reached or perceived. 

**SETI**: An abbreviation for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">search for extraterrestrial intelligence</span>, meaning life on other worlds. 

**sibling**: An offspring that shares the same parents (with its brother or sister). 

**spectrometer**: An instrument that measures a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spectrum</span>, such as light, energy, or atomic mass. Typically, chemists use these instruments to measure and report the wavelengths of light that it observes. The collection of data using this instrument (a process is known as <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spectrometry</span>) can help identify the elements or molecules present in an unknown sample. 

**<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spectroscopy</span>:** The study of how light and other types of radiation interact with matter. 

**square**: (in geometry) A rectangle with four sides of equal length. (In mathematics) A number multiplied by itself, or the verb meaning to multiply a number by itself. The square of 2 is 4; the square of 10 is 100. 

**star**: The basic building block from which galaxies are made. Stars develop when gravity compacts clouds of gas. When they become hot enough, stars will emit light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The sun is our closest star. 

**survey**: To view, examine, measure or evaluate something, often land or broad aspects of a landscape. 

**system**: A network of parts that together work to achieve some function. For instance, the blood, vessels and heart are primary components of the human body's circulatory system. Similarly, trains, platforms, tracks, roadway signals and overpasses are among the potential components of a nation's railway system. System can even be applied to the processes or ideas that are part of some method or ordered set of procedures for getting a task done. 

**technology**: The application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, or the devices, processes and systems that result from those efforts. 

**telescope**: Usually a light-collecting instrument that makes distant objects appear nearer through the use of lenses or a combination of curved mirrors and lenses. Some, however, collect radio emissions (energy from a different portion of the electromagnetic spectrum) through a network of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">antennas</span>. 

**universe**: The entire cosmos: All things that exist throughout space and time. It has been expanding since its formation during an event known as the Big Bang, some 13.8 billion years ago (give or take a few hundred million years). 

**wave**: A disturbance or variation that travels through space and matter in a regular, oscillating fashion. 

**wavelength**: The distance between one peak and the next in a series of waves, or the distance between one trough and the next. It’s also one of the “yardsticks” used to measure radiation. Visible light — which, like all electromagnetic radiation, travels in waves — includes wavelengths between about 380 nanometers (violet) and about 740 nanometers (red). Radiation with wavelengths shorter than visible light includes gamma rays, X-rays and ultraviolet light. Longer-wavelength radiation includes infrared light, microwaves and radio waves.
