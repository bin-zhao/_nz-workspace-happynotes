FLORA LICHTMAN: This is Science Friday. I’m Flora Lichtman. If you’ve found yourself <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">scrolling</span> through the online <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">breastfeeding</span> world, you know that people have a lot of strong opinions about breast milk. It’s a magical <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">elixir</span>. Breast is best. Look at how big my baby got after three months of exclusive breastfeeding is a video I get served a lot more than I’d like.

But what exactly do we about the biology of breast milk? Does breast milk really adapt to a baby’s needs? Does it <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">confer</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">immunity</span>? How does making breast milk impact the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">breastfeeder</span>? Here to spin through the science of this very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sophisticated</span> substance are two experts in the field, Dr. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Shelley</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">McGuire</span>, professor at the University of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Idaho</span> and director of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Margaret</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Richie</span> School of Family and Consumer Sciences, based in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Moscow</span>, Idaho. And Dr. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Deepshika</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Ramanan</span>, assistant professor at the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Salk</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Institute</span> for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Biological</span> Studies, based in San <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Diego</span>, California. Welcome to you both to Science Friday.

DEEPSHIKA RAMANAN: Thank you for having me.

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: I echo that. It’s great to be here.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Shelley, let’s start with you. You have researched breast milk for decades. To me, it seems like a pretty important substance for human existence. How much attention has it gotten from science?

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: Oh, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">golly</span>, what a question. Thanks for asking that. Yeah, this is the most important food that Mother Nature has ever created. And it seems like we should know everything about it, but we don’t. We know more about what’s in a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">strawberry</span> than what’s in human milk. And that’s not because there aren’t people interested in it. And that’s not because there aren’t great scientists. But the funding for this topic really has been not where it should be. And I could go on about that for hours.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Well, why is it special?

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: Well, if you think about it, which most people don’t, but if you think about it, human milk or breast milk is the only food that’s been <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">evolutionarily</span> designed to feed humans. Everything else that we eat has been <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">co-opted</span> by humans for human <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">consumption</span>. But this is a food that is so special because it’s the only food of its type. And we really need to understand what is in human milk because that is what is really evolutionarily designed to start humans off. It’s probably the most important food that we have.

FLORA LICHTMAN: You’ve made this point that we have doctors for other body parts, but not for this. Will you talk about that?

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: Yeah, again, something that most of us don’t think about, but there are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">neurosurgeons</span>, there are foot doctors, there are heart doctors, but there’s no such thing as a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">specialty</span> for the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mammary</span> gland or breast. And to me, that seems a little <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">odd</span>. I think that is based in the fact that it is, of course, a women’s issue, and there’s so much other stuff that’s around breasts and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">breastfeeding</span> that I think it just hasn’t been a topic that we’ve been all that interested in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tackling</span>, unfortunately. And I think it’s time we do that.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Shika, anything to add?

DEEPSHIKA RAMANAN: Yeah, and I would say I’ve been studying breast milk <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">immunity</span> for the last few years, and what got me interested in that is my own experience of becoming a mother. And I think part of the reason why we don’t have a lot more research on this is because we don’t have enough women doing the work, and we don’t have enough mothers doing the work. And I think that brings the point of having more women in science and more mothers in science to ask these questions that people didn’t think of asking before.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Let’s talk about <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">immunity</span> in the role of breast milk. You researched this, Shika. What do we know about how that works, how breast milk can transfer immunity to babies?

DEEPSHIKA RAMANAN: Yeah, so it’s been known for a few decades that breast milk has <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">antibodies</span> that are protective for the babies. And mothers pass these antibodies in the breast milk. And what it means is, if mother receives a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vaccine</span> or an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">infection</span> to a certain <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bug</span> or a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pathogen</span>, then they develop antibodies against that pathogen, and then they provide those antibodies through breast milk to their babies because babies actually don’t start making antibodies until they’re a little bit older. So until the babies are able to make their own antibodies, mothers will provide this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">passive</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">immunity</span>.

But what’s actually <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">striking</span> is that antibodies are not the only <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">protective</span> thing in breast milk. There is just so much more going on. And breast milk is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bioactive</span>. There are so many live <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">immune</span> cells in breast milk. There are so many other factors in breast milk, including the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">oligosaccharides</span>, which each mother custom-makes for their baby, which is just amazing.

FLORA LICHTMAN: What do you mean by that? Tell me more.

DEEPSHIKA RAMANAN: Yeah, every woman is custom-making the breast milk that their baby needs in terms of how much fat is in the milk, in terms of how much protein is in the milk. We don’t know a lot about the science behind this. We know that this does happen, but we still have a long way to go in understanding how this actually happens and what are the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">signals</span> that the baby’s giving the mom, and how do the moms then respond to this by making this custom milk for babies? I mean, this is just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fascinating</span>.

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: I agree. I’d like to just add a little bit on to that. What <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Shika</span> is saying is absolutely correct. There is this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">massive</span> variation in milk composition among women, even within a woman. The milk she produces at the beginning of a feed is different from the end of a feed. Milk produced around the world is different. But the thing is, we don’t know if that matters. So it’s a very interesting thing to say that milk is customized to the baby, but we don’t know if that matters. I consider things like that really interesting <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fairy</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tales</span> right now that need a lot of research to understand.

DEEPSHIKA RAMANAN: Yeah, I absolutely agree. We’ve been studying immune cells in milk, and we just had a story come out yesterday about how we found these immune cells that are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">migrating</span> from the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intestine</span> of the mom to the mammary <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gland</span> during <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pregnancy</span> and breastfeeding. But we don’t know what these immune cells mean for the baby. We’ve seen in human milk that there’s a lot of these immune cells.

FLORA LICHTMAN: So not just antibodies, but actually live, like, T cells.

DEEPSHIKA RAMANAN: Yes, these are live immune cells. And what we specifically found is T cells, yes, correct.

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: And I’ll add on to that. In addition to immune cells that migrate, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bacteria</span> migrate. We used to think that human milk was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sterile</span>. Guess what? It’s not. Nothing is sterile. And we think that some of those bacteria are actually coming to the breast from the mother’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intestine</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Why would they be coming from the intestine?

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: So our whole systems are set up to process the environment through our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gastrointestinal</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tracts</span>. And so our gastrointestinal tracts have so many <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">microbes</span> in there. And it’s a reflection of what we’re coming into contact with in our environment.

So if you think about it, the mom comes in contact with these microbes. Maybe she wants to teach the baby that these microbes should be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tolerated</span> and are OK. So they’re transported to the breast, they’re put into the milk, the mom says, OK, these are OK bacteria. Don’t respond to them with some sort of a bad immune response. So again, I’m <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">weaving</span> a fairy <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tale</span> here about what we think, but we don’t know, to be honest.

DEEPSHIKA RAMANAN: Yeah, we don’t how this might be helpful for babies and what it is doing to the immune system in the babies. But the other thing I think we don’t think enough about is what does that do for the mothers? Because you now have this huge <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">influx</span> of immune cells that are coming from in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intestine</span> or even other parts of the body to the mammary gland now, to the breast tissue. And you potentially also have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">microbes</span>.

And there has been a lot of work showing how breastfeeding has been helpful for mothers. So it speeds <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">postpartum</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">recovery</span>. And also some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">correlative</span> evidence saying that for every year a woman breastfeeds, they are less likely to develop breast, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">uterine</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ovarian</span> cancers later on in life, as well as other <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">chronic</span> diseases such as heart disease and type 2 <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">diabetes</span>. But we still don’t know a lot about how is this process <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">protective</span>. And it obviously doesn’t protect everybody. So how does it protect some women but not others? And there’s a lot left to do in this area as well.

FLORA LICHTMAN: If this turns out to be more than a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">correlation</span>, that actually it is protective for parents to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">breastfeed</span>, could this be an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">evolutionary</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">adaptation</span>? Now that you have a baby, you got to be kept alive to take care of it.

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: Yeah, I think you’re right on with that. Of course, this is evolutionary. I mean, this is the only way that babies were fed for a very, very long time. And so we have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">evolved</span> to do things well. Mother Nature is a smart thing. And this process does have to be protective to the baby and to the mom in the long run. Otherwise, it’s way too much energy to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">invest</span> in a biological process.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I have to come back to this, this idea that breast milk is not sterile, that it’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bioactive</span>, it’s filled with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">microbes</span>. Why did I spend what felt like years of my life <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sterilizing</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">flanges</span>?

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: Well, OK, there’s a good reason for that. Maybe we’ve gone <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">overboard</span>. But we have no reason to think that the bacteria that are in human milk cause a problem. But we do have– there is something called <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">foodborne</span> illness that you can get from other things.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I am familiar with that, yeah.

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: It’s not a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ridiculous</span> idea. But this idea that everything that we feed our babies should be sterile, I think we’ve <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">debunked</span> that now.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Shelley, how much <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">variety</span> is there in breast milk across the world. Is it like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Budweiser</span>? It’s pretty consistent no matter where you’re drinking it?

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: It is not like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Budweiser</span> in a lot of ways. It’s very different. We did a study a few years ago. We collected milk in nine different countries around the world. And so many things are different. And the question is, does it matter? I would like to think that it does. I would like to think that that milk produced by those moms, let’s say, in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rural</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Ethiopia</span>, is setting those babies up for success in rural Ethiopia, and that milk in Spain is setting babies up for success in Spain. But again, that’s one of these fairy tales that we would like to be able to support with science.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I think a lot of people who are breastfeeding also end up thinking a lot about what they’re consuming, and they’re really <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cautious</span> about what they put in their bodies because they don’t want it passed along. And it seems like there’s a lot of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">uncertainty</span> around this. Shelley, I know that you’re studying <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">maternal</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cannabis</span> use. What have you learned and why are you focusing on that?

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: Oh <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gosh</span>, what a hot topic. So <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">recreational</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cannabis</span> has just recently been <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">legalized</span> in a lot of states. And like so many things, we don’t really know the impact on milk composition or <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">infant</span> outcomes. And so when <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cannabis</span> became legalized in the state of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Washington</span> a few years ago, my <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">colleague</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Courtney</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Meehan</span>, who’s at Washington State University, we put our heads together and we said, we need to understand this because right now, the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">recommendation</span> is that breastfeeding women not use cannabis. And that’s based on just being super, super careful. It’s not based on science.

And so what we do know so far is that women who use cannabis during breastfeeding, the active component THC, does show up in milk. But again, we have all this variation. In some women, it shows up a lot. In some women, it hardly shows up. In some women, it lasts a long time. In other women, it disappears.

So we’re just learning the basics about that. We know nothing about potential impacts on the baby at this point. There is a lot to learn. A lot about <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">alcohol</span> right now, but almost nothing about cannabis. So we’re keeping an open mind because another thing I’ll tell you that we’ve learned is that at least in our experience, women are using cannabis for all the right reasons. They feel like it’s safer than <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">prescription</span> drugs, let’s say, for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">anxiety</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">postpartum</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">depression</span>. And they really want to know whether it’s OK to use or not. But we just don’t know.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I mean, there is a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stigma</span> that applies to cannabis that does not apply to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">antidepressants</span> or pain <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pills</span>, which are prescribed.

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: Yeah. But a lot of those drugs also haven’t been studied a whole lot in breastfeeding women. So we’ve got a lot of work to do.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I think there can be a lot of pressure on people to breastfeed. I’m sure you’ve come across this. A lot of people can’t for a lot of reasons. A lot of people choose not to for a lot of good reasons. You all are breast milk scientists. You’re human milk scientists. What is your take on this?

DEEPSHIKA RAMANAN: You know, as a mom, myself, we have enough mom <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">guilt</span>. I don’t think we need to be putting more guilt on ourselves. If I’m not breastfeeding the baby, then I am setting up my baby for a lifetime of failure in terms of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">immunity</span> or something like that. We’ve got to do what’s best for us and the baby. I mean, and if that means that you are going to give the baby <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">formula</span>, that’s absolutely fine.

The truth is, like Shelley said, we still have a long way to go in terms of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">figuring</span> out what is it about breast milk and what is in breast milk that is protective, or how is it impacting the health of the babies? And once we have more information on that, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hopefully</span>, we can make formula better, and maybe we can even offer women a way to become better producers because one of the reasons why women don’t breastfeed or can’t, it’s because they can’t breastfeed.

And maybe we can find a way to offer women the option if they wanted to breastfeed and they can’t, that they could maybe take a certain <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">probiotic</span> or a certain <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dietary</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">supplement</span> that would help with that. But my take is, we have a long way to go. And if, right now, you are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">struggling</span> with breastfeeding, don’t stress about it too much. Just offer your baby formula, and it’ll be OK.

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: I’d like to follow up a little bit on that. One thing I want to make <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crystal</span> clear is that we do know that breastfeeding saves babies lives in areas of the world where there is no safe <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">alternative</span>. So I want to be very– I want to be crystal clear about that. And we do know that there are benefits of breastfeeding.

But what we also know is that babies, at least in places like the United States, can do quite well on other forms of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nutrition</span>. And so we just have to make sure we’re putting all of this in perspective and looking at the big picture.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I mean, you kind of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">alluded</span> to this, but is there a world where understanding breast milk better actually helps us make a better formula?

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: Oh, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gosh</span>, yeah, absolutely. I mean, I tell you what, I have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fabulous</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">colleagues</span> that work for companies that make formula, and that’s exactly what they want to do. And they are trying to use what we know about human milk <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">composition</span> in the most <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ethical</span>, scientific way to make their formulas better.

DEEPSHIKA RAMANAN: Yeah, and we’ve come a long way. I mean, I think 10-15 years ago, all of the formulas were based on <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cow</span> milk. And to some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">extent</span>, they still are. But if you go to the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">supermarket</span> right now, you see that there are a lot of formulas that are designed to be closer to human milk. And we still have a long way to go on that. But there has been a change in the last few years, I would say.

FLORA LICHTMAN: We’re just about out of time. Do you have final thoughts on this, things you want our audience to, or things you don’t know about breast milk that you’re dying to learn?

DEEPSHIKA RAMANAN: I will say, when we pick up an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ingredient</span> in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">grocery</span> store, when we pick up a food, we know exactly what’s in it. And being that breast milk is the first food that most babies get, and we don’t know enough about it, there is still so much left to find out about the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wonders</span> of breast milk.

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: Yeah, I agree. I am actually very, very positive about the future of this sort of research. I think there’s a renewed interest in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">infant</span> health, infant <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nutrition</span>, child health, and I just have a lot of hope that we’re going to see a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">resurgence</span> and a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">renaissance</span> of human milk research in the next few years.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Shelley, I hope you’re right.

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: Yeah, me too.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Thank you both for taking the time today.

SHELLEY MCGUIRE: You’re very welcome. Thanks for having us.

DEEPSHIKA RAMANAN: Yeah, thank you for having us. This was great.
