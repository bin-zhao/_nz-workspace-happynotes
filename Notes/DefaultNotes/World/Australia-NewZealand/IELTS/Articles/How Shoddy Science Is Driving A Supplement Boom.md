FLORA LICHTMAN: But how effective are supplements? How safe are they? How are they regulated? And why are these <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">remedies</span> so appealing to us? Here to help us size up of science and culture of supplements are Dr. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Pieter Cohen</span>, head of the supplement research program, an associate professor of medicine at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Harvard Medical School</span>, and an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">internist</span> at the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Cambridge Health Alliance</span> based in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Somerville</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Massachusetts</span>. And Dr. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Colleen Derkatch</span>, author of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Why Wellness Sells: Natural Health in a Pharmaceutical Culture</span>. She’s also a professor of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rhetoric</span> at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Toronto Metropolitan University</span>, based in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Ontario</span>, Canada. OK, welcome to you both to Science Friday.

PIETER COHEN: Thanks for having us.

COLLEEN DERKATCH: Yes, hi. Thanks.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Let’s start with some definitions. Pieter, what makes something a dietary supplement versus a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">medication</span>?

PIETER COHEN: That’s a great question. A dietary supplement doesn’t really mean anything. It’s just a legal term that was invented over 25 years ago by <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Congress</span>. And it’s part of the law to combine many different types of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ingredients</span> together into this category of dietary supplements. So they can include vitamins, minerals, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">amino acids</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">protein powders</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">botanical</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">porcine</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">thyroid extracts</span>, live <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">microorganisms</span> like bacteria and fungus, so it’s a real mixed bag.

FLORA LICHTMAN: This is a big <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bucket</span>, I’m hearing.

PIETER COHEN: Very big. Yeah.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Colleen, what about our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">perception</span>. I mean, how does our perception of what a supplement is match with this bucket.

COLLEEN DERKATCH: It’s about as varied as the bucket itself, I would say. Yeah, people think of supplements as all kinds of things. They think of them as <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fundamentally</span> distinct from <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pharmaceuticals</span>. And that’s one of the reasons why they’re so powerful. People really believe that they are basically farm to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">capsule</span>, that these are plants that are grown in very kind of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bucolic</span> fields with little down home families farming and somehow they magic their way into capsule form.

And the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">similarities</span> to pharmaceuticals become a lot <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">murkier</span>. They are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pills</span> in bottles, they are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">synthesized</span> in labs, there’s a lot of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">correspondence</span> between the two things. They are products that people take to effect a change in the body. And for a lot of people, that’s really appealing because they may be concerned about what’s going into pharmaceuticals, they may be concerned about the pharmaceutical industry, they may be feeling like doctors don’t really care about their health or don’t get to root causes. And so supplements are able to behave like both things at the same time. And I think that that’s really powerful. People do find that quite appealing.

FLORA LICHTMAN: How does supplement culture <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intertwine</span> with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">MAHA</span> culture and this move towards you being in charge of your own health?

COLLEEN DERKATCH: I mean, from where I sit, it’s not surprising to me. So if you look at the history of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wellness</span> culture, it has always had a really strong <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">libertarian</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">streak</span> to it. And I think we’re seeing some of that come to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fruition</span> right now. When people use supplements, they frequently serve primarily as symbols of other things. And I think that that’s what’s really important is that the actual intervention that people buy and swallow with water represents so much more than just what’s in the capsule or the pill.

And people are seeking to return to a state of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">purity</span>. And whether that’s purity from chemicals that they think are in their body, or chemicals from pharmaceuticals, or even if they just want to do something for themselves to make them feel better, to make them feel like they’re taking care of themselves, to make them feel like they’re good people, and a lot of that connects back to decades now of public health messaging in both the US and in Canada, where I live, that we are, each of us, responsible for our own health. We each need to take steps to support and enhance our health and supplements really tap into that.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Pieter, how are dietary supplements regulated?

PIETER COHEN: So here in the United States, the concept is that all those <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ingredients</span> we were talking about are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">presumed</span> to be safe to consume and can be sold directly to consumers. The FDA is just in the position, who technically <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">oversees</span> supplements– the FDA is in the position of just keeping an eye out and in case there is something that they detect, that there’s danger coming from the supplements, they can take steps– small, baby steps, actually– to try to remove those products from the marketplace. So it’s very much <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reliant on</span> the industry to self-police and ensure that their own products are safe.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I mean, “presumed safe” sounds <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">unnerving</span> to me, personally.

PIETER COHEN: Well, the concept came around because of the FDA’s efforts, back in the 1970s and to 1980s, to try to more tightly regulate vitamins and minerals. And the FDA made some moves to try to make it such that certain high <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">doses of</span> vitamins like, let’s say, a dose of 10 or 20 times what was necessary in a day– if that was going to be marketed, that should go through a more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stringent</span> regulatory review by the FDA. And it was in a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">backlash</span> against that move by the FDA that led to the current laws that really tell the FDA hands-off here. We can sell what we want to and consumers can purchase what they want to.

FLORA LICHTMAN: We asked our listeners to weigh in on this topic and we got many, many calls. People had a lot of thoughts and feelings about this, which I’m sure will not surprise you two because you work in this field. Let’s go to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Maggie</span> in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Montana</span>.

SPEAKER 4: I wanted to tell you that I was a truck driver for a little more than seven years. And I was shopping one day and I had some vitamins on sale, so I picked them up. And it turned out that they really made a difference in my performance, my ability to stay with the job and have physical energy. And that was– CoQ10 was the unusual item in there. And I want to make sure that I’m not <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ill-advising</span> my friends.

FLORA LICHTMAN: C-o-Q10 or CoQ10, I’ve heard it called. Pieter, what do we about this supplement?

PIETER COHEN: Well, like many supplements, there’s a very important role for this in modern medicine. In this case, it’s a very important <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">enzyme</span> that’s at the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cornerstone</span> of how we generate energy in the body and the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mitochondria</span>. And some people– it’s rare but have genetic disorders that don’t make enough <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">coenzyme Q10</span>. And in those situations, it’s a cornerstone of treatment. Now, it doesn’t always work, but it’s certainly what should be tried first.

It’s that utility that then leads to interest in using it in other situations. And, for one, it’s been studied extensively for people who have muscle <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">aches</span> after taking common <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cholesterol</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">medications</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">statins</span>. And, in that case, it’s found not to be particularly effective. And I’m not aware of other strong evidence to suggest that healthy people, who don’t have these rare genetic disorders, would have great benefit from coenzyme Q10, but that doesn’t stop the supplement industry from being able to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">promote</span> it for a variety of reasons.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I want to dig in a little bit on this because, Pieter, you said you don’t a lot of good evidence to back up the idea that it will help healthy people. And that seems common for a lot of supplements. Is that because we haven’t done enough research into supplements or is it because scientists have done research into supplements and actually it just doesn’t support being helpful.

PIETER COHEN: It’s a combination of both. In some areas there’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">extensive</span> research. So a good example of that is a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">multivitamin</span>. So we have very well-conducted, large, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">randomized</span> controlled trials showing that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">multivitamins</span> really don’t help much, unless people have vitamin <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">deficiencies</span> or need them–

FLORA LICHTMAN: Do not help much.

PIETER COHEN: Right. But they also don’t hurt. So they’re not going to be causing cancer or increasing risk of heart disease. They’re pretty <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">neutral</span>. Now, with a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">majority</span> of other supplements, they haven’t been studied in large trials. And there’s no <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">incentive</span> to at this point because when the industry can market products directly to consumers, which, as I mentioned, I’m a fan of having access, that means that the manufacturers don’t have incentive to do the large studies to sort out what works and what doesn’t work, particularly because the manufacturers can also <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">advertise</span> their products with all sorts of claims, such that it will help with everything from brain health, to the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">immune system</span>, to giving you more energy without having to prove that in human <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">clinical</span> trials.

COLLEEN DERKATCH: And they’re also limited to the types of claims they can make. So they can make structure claims. They can make claims about supporting health without making disease claims. And I think that’s a really important distinction because then you can kind of say anything. What I found is that people just translate them in their own minds and so they’ll see “support sleep” on a bottle of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">melatonin</span> and they’ll translate that to treats <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">insomnia</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Right. I want to bring in another listener who has his own experience with this subject. He wrote the nutrition <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">curriculum</span> at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Yale Medical School</span>.

SPEAKER 5: This is D. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Barry Boyd</span>. I am a physician <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">oncologist</span>. I would avoid the use of very high dose supplements. One classic one is B12. And people are completely unaware of this, including physicians, that B12 has been linked, at higher doses, to a higher risk of lung cancers. And why would that be? It <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">activates</span> cell growth, cell <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">replication</span>, and, as a result, you end up raising the risk of diseases like lung cancer and is very easy to give it because you think it’s great for fatigue or other reasons. Those are not appropriate approaches to using B12 in very high doses.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I would love to hear what you all think of this. I mean, I’ve had many doctors offering me a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">B12 shot</span>.

PIETER COHEN: Right. Well, I think this is a great example of how vitamins and minerals are active in the human body. And a small amount, which might be helpful, could lead to some benefit, if someone is deficient in the vitamin or under the mineral. But at higher <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dosages</span>, you’re pretty much, with all the vitamins and minerals, eventually going to run into trouble. And that’s a problem with how these products are marketed. Because they’re <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">presumed</span> safe, basically by Congress defining them as safe, it gives the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">impression</span> to consumers that if a little bit of a vitamin is good, then a lot must be better. And that, unfortunately, is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">inaccurate</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I mean– but many of the supplements you see that are not multivitamins, but just one compound, one mineral will say this gives you 453% of your daily value. How do I interpret that number? Is that real? And is it a good thing?

PIETER COHEN: Right. So I think that gets to another issue that we haven’t talked about yet, which is manufacturing problems and manufacturing control, quality control in the supplement industry. This is a very serious problem. And, in fact, I really wouldn’t trust most of that information that I see on the label.

We did a study of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">melatonin</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gummies</span> to see how did the actual quantity of melatonin in the gummies compare to the labeled amount of melatonin. And what we found was really surprising. I was expecting to find <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">variability</span> and I thought some manufacturers might have not included enough melatonin. But, in fact, it was the opposite, really. We found that there was much more melatonin in most of the gummies than expected or than listed on the label–

FLORA LICHTMAN: Wow.

PIETER COHEN: –and sometimes two or three times more. So this is the situation where consumers really can’t get a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">straight</span> story about what’s in the supplement just by reading the labels. And that has to do with very profound problems in manufacturing a supplement.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Have you found ingredients that don’t even belong there.

PIETER COHEN: Yes. So we’ve done many studies looking deeply at what’s actually in the pills. And in the melatonin study we did, we found CBD. And CBD–

FLORA LICHTMAN: Really.

PIETER COHEN: –should not be sold as a dietary supplement. So that’s an example of finding other things. But we’ve also found in many other studies that we have, in the supplement supply in the United States, chemicals and pharmaceutical drugs that might be approved or not even approved in other countries are appearing in the United States in dietary supplements.

FLORA LICHTMAN: We’ve talked about the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shortfalls</span> of supplements and some of the risks. Is there promise in the supplement world to actually develop new, effective treatments?

PIETER COHEN: Well, I think that the problem is– unfortunately, the situation is designed such that since you can go and start selling products without having done the research, it doesn’t encourage innovation. So that’s going to be a challenge for– in the future– is can we create a situation where consumers have access to supplements, which I believe is important, but, at the same time, we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">incentivize</span> good science and research to find out which ones can benefit human health.

COLLEEN DERKATCH: Yeah, I agree. And I think, for me, a lot of it comes to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">legislation</span>. We can’t be sure about what is in supplements because supplement manufacturers are not required to investigate that. Years ago in Canada, our CBC, the national <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">broadcaster</span>, did a very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hilarious</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">notorious</span> investigation where they got approval to sell a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">homeopathic</span> sleep aid from Health Canada by literally <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pouring tap</span> water into a bottle, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">photocopying</span> a couple of pages of a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">homeopathy</span> textbook, and creating a marketing <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">campaign</span>. And they got a natural health product number to sell that product legally in Canada as a sleep aid for children. And, to me, that shows that the biggest hole, I think, is that legislation isn’t requiring manufacturers to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">guarantee</span> the safety and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">efficacy</span> of their products. And consumers don’t know that because they go to their local <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pharmacy</span>, which they trust, and they see these bottles on the shelf next to products like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Tylenol</span> Cold and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Flu</span> and other products that are tested for safety. And so people believe that the bottles contain what they say they contain and will do what they say they do. But we know that’s not true.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Thank you both for this conversation.

COLLEEN DERKATCH: Thank you.
