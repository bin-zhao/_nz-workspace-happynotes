FLORA LICHTMAN: Hey, I’m Flora Lichtman, and you’re listening to Science Friday.

[THEME MUSIC]

Today, on the show, the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mysteries</span> of sand <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dunes</span>, including how to make them sing.

NATHALIE VRIEND: We create this very tiny sand <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">avalanche</span>. And at that moment, if the conditions are right, your entire body starts to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vibrate</span>. It’s a very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">imposing</span> feeling.

[THEME MUSIC]

FLORA LICHTMAN: With September upon us, maybe you’re thinking, it’s time to leave the sun and sand behind. But we are not ready. So today, we’re spending a moment on sand. In particular, dunes. From beaches to deserts, sand dunes are this important geological feature. In some places, dunes protect the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shore</span> and, of course, the beach houses behind them from the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">onslaught</span> of ocean waves. In other places, the dunes themselves are on the move, threatening homes and roads and even entire cities.

Joining me now, to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sift</span> out some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">grains</span> of truth about sand, is Dr. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Nathalie</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Vriend</span>. She’s an associate professor in mechanical engineering at the University of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Colorado</span> in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Boulder</span>. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Nathalie</span>, welcome to Science Friday.

NATHALIE VRIEND: Thank you, Flora.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I feel like most of us have known a dune, have met a dune, but not like you know dunes. So let’s start with some one-on-one stuff. What is the difference between a dune and a big <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pile</span> of sand? Is there one?

NATHALIE VRIEND: Ooh, I’m not sure if there’s a huge difference. Like a pile of sand, we’ve all been building them in our sand <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pits</span>, when we were little kids, with our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shovel</span> and our little <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sieve</span>. And a sand pile is actually just forming almost a triangle, if you look from the side. The sand grains are kind of rolling down, and those sand grains are stable when they’re about an angle of 30 degrees. So anything <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">steeper</span>, and they will just avalanche down. So that’s our typical sand pile that we know.

Now, if we scale it up from the sand pit to a large dune, either at the beach or in the desert, we still have that pile, but it’s just much, much larger. And of course, one important difference is that if we are in a desert, we might have some wind blowing. And that wind will actually make that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">symmetrical</span> pile <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">asymmetrical</span>. And we still have that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">steep</span> side on one side. But on the other side, there is, perhaps, a gradual increase. So that’s a difference between our tiny pile in our sand pit and a large desert dune.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Are there varieties of dunes?

NATHALIE VRIEND: Absolutely. There are many different varieties of sand dunes. If you go to the desert and you actually look at it from a satellite image, you can see different shapes. And it all depends on how much sand is available in that specific regional <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spot</span> and how the wind is blowing.

If the wind is always blowing from, let’s say, the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">northern</span> direction, then the sand dune is quite <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">uniform</span>, and it just always travels south. And that creates certain shapes that are very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">characteristic</span> for wind <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">regimes</span> that are just going in one direction. However, if you are, let’s say, in a place where there are mountains and the wind is sometimes, in the summer, coming from the north and sometimes, coming from the south, in the winter, you can get very different shapes. So it’s not one size fits all.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Does the type of sand make the dune, too?

NATHALIE VRIEND: So if you think about a sand dune, the sand itself is actually a grain size. We call it sand, but it’s a very specific grain size.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Wait, are you telling me sand is not a substance, it’s a size?

NATHALIE VRIEND: It is. It is. If you go smaller, you get <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">clay</span>, which we find in our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">soil</span>. If you go bigger, you get your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gravel</span>, which we might find in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">riverbeds</span>. So sand is actually a size, but we know it as a substance, right? But the substance has a chemical composition. So most of the sand grains we know are made of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">quartz</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">feldspar</span>. These are chemical substances, but it’s not the only one.

We can also find sand dunes and sand made of something called <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gypsum</span>. And I don’t know if you’ve ever been to the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">White Sands National Park</span>, Flora, but those dunes are really white. They look different. Like, the sand looks very different. And those sand grains are made from gypsum.

FLORA LICHTMAN: And physically, how do you think about a dune? Is it a solid? Is it–

NATHALIE VRIEND: No.

FLORA LICHTMAN: –a solid on the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">verge</span> of being a liquid or a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">non-Newtonian fluid</span>? What is it?

NATHALIE VRIEND: So it’s very interesting. It depends on how deep you look inside of the dune, what kind of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">magnification</span> you use. So if you would go all the way down, to the individual sand grain, then those sand grains are quite solid, and they <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bounce</span> against each other, perhaps <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">deform</span> a little bit, roll over each other. But that is just the grain <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">interaction</span>.

And then let’s actually make it a step bigger. So if I would have many grains in my hand, I can <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pour</span> them out, and they form a little <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">heap</span>, like what we find in a sand pit. And at that moment, that heap is solid. But as I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pour</span> it out of my hand, it’s a fluid. And then, if I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">toss up</span> the grains into the air, it flies away in the wind, and it’s more like a gas. So that is like the intermediate step. But then if I take a step even further back and I look at the big, big sand dune, the dune has a physical behavior as well. But perhaps the information of the individual sand grain is lost at that moment.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Is that why they’re cool to you, as a mechanical engineer?

NATHALIE VRIEND: I lost sand dunes. It started when I was a kid. So I grew up in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Netherlands</span>, and my parents took me, sometimes, to the coast. And there was this large dune. At least, for a kid, it was a large dune. And I climbed up to the top, and I would run down, as fast as I could.

FLORA LICHTMAN: We’ve all been there.

– Exactly. And then, when I was starting <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">grad</span> school, I discovered this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fantastic</span> topic that my PhD <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">supervisor</span> was already investigating with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">undergraduate</span> students, and that was on the so-called <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">booming</span> sand dunes or singing sand dunes. And I found it so <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mystical</span>, and I was able to connect my fluid and solid <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mechanics</span> that I learned in undergrad with some new techniques derived from <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">geophysics</span> and Earth sciences, and I was fascinated. I was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hooked</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: We have a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">clip</span> of one of those singing sand dunes. Let’s listen to it.

[SAND DUNE HUMMING]

I feel like I’m on the set of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Arrakis</span>.

NATHALIE VRIEND: [LAUGHS] It’s even more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">impressive</span> if you’re there, on the dune. So we create this sound by just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sliding down</span> the steep face of the dune, which is the angle of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">repose</span>, which is about 30 degrees. And we create this very tiny sand avalanche. And at that moment, if the conditions are right, which typically means in the middle of the summer, your entire body starts to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vibrate</span>. It’s a very imposing feeling, to create this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">booming</span> sand dune sound.

And I’ve taken classes of undergraduate students for field work, where we were actually a few miles away, and a second group was creating this sound on the sand dune, and we could hear it so clearly from so far away. So it’s quite an experience.

FLORA LICHTMAN: So it’s the sound of sand moving?

NATHALIE VRIEND: It’s the sound of sand moving, but it’s not only the sound of sand. You also need some kind of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">amplification</span>. Because what you heard, it’s quite loud. So in my PhD research, we discovered that there is also a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">resonator</span> within the dune that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">amplifies</span> this bouncing of sand grains, on the surface, in the avalanche. It <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">resonates</span>, and it amplifies the sound to something that we can hear from miles away.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Wow. We mentioned, at the top this problem of moving dunes, dunes <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shifting</span>. Tell us about that.

NATHALIE VRIEND: So more recently, I’ve done quite a bit of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fieldwork</span> in the Middle East, in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Qatar</span>. And we looked at these mobile <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">barchan</span> dunes, which are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">swiftly</span> moving dunes that exist in an area of the desert where the wind is blowing mainly from one direction. And these dunes are traveling quite fast. They <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">overtake</span> each other every time they <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rebirth</span>. If you cut a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">trench</span> in them, you can see these layers appearing from where the dune was, let’s say, a few weeks ago.

It’s very similar to tree rings. If you cut a tree, you can see the tree rings, and you can see certain years where the tree was growing faster and slower. So in these dunes, if you cut a trench straight through, you can also see layers where there was more avalanching activity than in other times. And that’s basically my recent work, where we looked at sand dunes that move fast and at what we can learn from the internal structure.

FLORA LICHTMAN: What does fast mean in dune speed?

NATHALIE VRIEND: You can easily <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">outrun</span> it. So let’s put some length and time scales in it, because it’s difficult to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">conceive</span>. So in the dunes that we were looking at, the smaller dune was perhaps 5 meters high and perhaps 100 meters across, and it moved about 20 meters per year.

FLORA LICHTMAN: 20 meters? That’s not nothing, though.

NATHALIE VRIEND: It’s not nothing. And then the larger dunes that we also climbed up– it took a little while before we got to the top. These dunes were 30, 40 meters high. They’re about half a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">kilometer</span> across, so perhaps a football field. And these dunes only move a few meters per year. So different-sized dunes actually <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">coexist</span> in that dune field.

And the funny thing about dunes is that small dunes actually move much faster than big dunes. So if you have a small dune behind the big dune, upwind of a big dune, it can <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">chase</span> it, and it can <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">interact</span>. And we have a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">plethora</span> of fun, physical behavior that results from that.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I want to see this time <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lapse</span>.

NATHALIE VRIEND: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Nowadays</span>, with our satellite images, you can actually track it without being there. I love <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fieldwork</span>. Don’t get me wrong. But the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">disadvantage</span> is that you’re there for a week, and you can only get a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">snapshot</span> of what’s going on at that moment. But if you want to track these longer term processes of dunes traveling across hundreds of meters, you either need to use satellite images, or you need to bring that experiment down to a much smaller scale in the lab.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Are you doing that? Are you bringing it down to a much smaller scale in the lab?

NATHALIE VRIEND: Yes, we are. We have our own dune machine. So we are running an experiment in our lab, where we create dunes in water. And in water, the dunes are moving much faster than they do in air. And as a result, we can speed up the process. And with the right scalings, we can still learn lessons about what’s happening in the field. But we can do these experiments in the lab much faster and more controlled as well.

FLORA LICHTMAN: It’s like the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fanciest</span> sandbox in the world.

NATHALIE VRIEND: I guess so. So the experiment is 2 meters across. But how we set it up, you wouldn’t be able to take a swim in it, but the sand grains are.

FLORA LICHTMAN: We have to take a break, but don’t go away. Because when we come back, we’re talking about traveling sand dunes and what they mean for people living nearby.

NATHALIE VRIEND: Slowly, surely, one by one, different areas of the city are just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">engulfed</span> by the sand. And it’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">heartbreaking</span> to look at, because entire <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">neighborhoods</span> are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">disappearing</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Where are these dunes that are moving most threatening to human <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">infrastructure</span>, to homes, to roads, to cities?

NATHALIE VRIEND: Not all dunes move. I just want to make that clear as well. And most <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">coastal</span> dunes are quite wet, and they have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vegetation</span> growing. And most of these dunes are not moving at all or just moving a little bit. And the biggest change at coastal dunes is perhaps <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">carving</span> away from storms that are coming to the coast, that are taking sand away, digging away. And then these dunes <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crumble</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">collapse</span>.

But most of the dunes that are at the coast are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fairly</span> stable, due to the vegetation. Their roots are helping it to stabilize the sand grains. If you go to much drier areas, let’s say, some parts of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Sahara</span>, these dunes move fast and they keep going. We have a lovely picture from the dunes in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Mauritania</span>. And they’re, unfortunately, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">encroaching</span> on the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">capital</span> of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Nouakchott</span>. And slowly, surely, one by one, different areas of the city are just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">engulfed</span> by the sand. And it’s heartbreaking to look at that, because entire neighborhoods are disappearing.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Wow. We hear a lot about <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">desertification</span> as a symptom of climate change. Does that mean this is going to be a growing problem in our future?

NATHALIE VRIEND: I think so, especially if there are a lot of cause and effect that you might not realize initially. So, for example, if rivers are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dammed</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">upstream</span> to preserve water for agriculture, for example, then <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">downstream</span> riverbeds become drier and drier. Lake beds might dry out and create a lot of dust and sand that can then be brought into the landscape and form dunes. So there is a lot of cause and effect that you might not realize, right away, what’s happening. And if there’s more sand, more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sediment</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">transport</span>, we call it, then we have more dunes appearing. And they just keep going.

FLORA LICHTMAN: What are your big burning sand questions? Like, what are the big things that haven’t been answered that you’re dying to know?

NATHALIE VRIEND: So we’ve done a lot of work over the last seven years with some of my students from my research group, where we were looking at sand dune interaction. So I mentioned earlier that small dunes move much faster than large dunes. So if you have a small dune chasing a large dune, you don’t exactly what happens. They might actually merge into one dune, or they may actually exchange some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sediment</span> and actually <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">coexist</span>, and then the front dune runs off again. So it’s like a game of chase.

So that’s what we’ve done a lot of work on recently. And another bit of research that we’ve done is putting obstacles in front of dunes and seeing what happens. And this is a direct application for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">resilience</span> in dry environments.

Because you can imagine, if you’re a farmer and there is a sand dune approaching your agricultural field, you might think, I’m building a little blockage to stop the sand. But from a fluid <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mechanics</span> point of view, that may actually <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">aggravate</span> the problem, because that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">blockage</span>, that little wall, might actually capture scent behind it and make the problem much worse. So there’s this interesting <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">interplay</span> between Earth science, sediment dynamics, fluid mechanics. And we really need to understand the physics in order to understand cause and effect.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Fascinating. Thank you so much for making this subject just the absolute opposite of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dusty</span>.

NATHALIE VRIEND: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Fantastic</span>. Thank you so much, Flora.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Dr. Natalie Vriend is an associate professor in mechanical engineering at the University of Colorado, in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Boulder</span>.
