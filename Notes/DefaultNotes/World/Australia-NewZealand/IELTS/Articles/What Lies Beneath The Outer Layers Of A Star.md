FLORA LICHTMAN: This is Science Friday. I’m Flora Lichtman. Later this hour, looking at the FDA’S push to reduce <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">artificial</span> food <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dyes</span>. And the problem of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pests</span> and whether they even are a problem. But first, you might think of a star as just a mass of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">incandescent</span> gas.

[THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS, “WHY DOES THE SUN SHINE”] The sun is a mass of incandescent gas, a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gigantic</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nuclear</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">furnace</span>. Where <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hydrogen</span> is built into <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">helium</span> at a temperature of millions of degrees. Yo ho, it’s hot!

Yo ho, it is hot. But a new study suggests stars aren’t just a big <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ol</span>’ mass of gas. This week, researchers report that they’ve observed some of what lies <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">beneath</span> all of that hydrogen and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">helium</span>, at least inside one unusual <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">supernova</span>. And they found layers, like a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">giant</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">blooming</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">onion</span>. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Astronomers</span> spotted this star in the act of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">exploding</span>, and they were able to see one of those inner layers. After all, that outer star stuff was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stripped</span> away.

Joining me now to talk about it is study author Doctor Steve <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Schulze</span>. They’re a research associate at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Northwestern</span> University’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">CIERA</span>– that’s the Center for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Interdisciplinary</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Exploration</span> and Research in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Astrophysics</span>. Steve, welcome to Science Friday.

STEVE SCHULZE: Hi, Flora. Nice to meet you.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Nice to meet you, too. So I’ve been trying to come up with the right <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">analogy</span>. How off base is a giant blooming onion?

STEVE SCHULZE: This is absolutely perfect, perfect description. So–

FLORA LICHTMAN: I think you’re being kind, but go ahead.

STEVE SCHULZE: Yeah. So <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">essentially</span> a star starts as a huge ball of hydrogen. But then through nuclear <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fusion</span>, it gets transformed into a structure of shells, and this is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">essentially</span> how an onion looks like. So stars at the end of their lives, they’re huge <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cosmic</span> onions.

FLORA LICHTMAN: So how unusual or unlikely was it to even capture this kind of dramatic moment in this star’s life?

STEVE SCHULZE: So we detect exploding stars <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">routinely</span> every night. This particular object is something that we have never observed before, and we didn’t even expect that something like this would exist. So when we started to see the data and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">grasp</span> what we are actually holding in our hands, we were completely <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">awestruck</span>. And the paper just came out and it’s like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reliving</span> all of the emotions again from– since discovery.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Wait, was it an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">emotional</span> moment when you first got the data?

STEVE SCHULZE: I wouldn’t say emotional, but it’s like, wow, what have you just discovered?

FLORA LICHTMAN: Did you know what you had when you saw it?

STEVE SCHULZE: No, not really. So when we detected the object, we tried to get a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spectrum</span> because the spectrum tells us something about the composition of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">supernova</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ejecta</span>. So for instance, how much hydrogen is there, how much <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">helium</span> is there, et cetera. But in this particular case, we immediately realized this is something that we have never observed before, but we didn’t what we actually did observe.

What is unusual about this object is that we have never observed an explosion of such a highly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stripped</span> star. We didn’t even that these stars could exist and that they could actually also explode as a supernova.

FLORA LICHTMAN: OK. So when you say stripped, what do you mean?

STEVE SCHULZE: So we have our cosmic onion and stars can lose their outer shells, for instance, through <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stellar</span> winds. They could also have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">eruptions</span> because of some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">instabilities</span> in their very cores. And this process of losing material through winds, eruptions, or interaction with a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">companion</span> star– this is what we call <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stripping</span>. And the stripping can not only lead to losing a small amount of mass, it can actually lead to losing shells of this cosmic onion.

FLORA LICHTMAN: OK, so it’s lost its outer– it’s lost its outer shell. Its outer– it’s the onion skin.

STEVE SCHULZE: Exactly. And not just one, but it can also lose several of those. The <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">outermost</span> shell is hydrogen. Then there comes helium, then comes carbon oxygen, then <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">magnesium</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">neon</span> and oxygen, oxygen <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">silicon</span>, and eventually the iron core.

So when we usually observe explosions from stars that were stripped, usually they have lost their hydrogen <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">envelope</span> or maybe then exposed the hydrogen layer. They could have also lost the hydrogen shell and then we only see the carbon oxygen. But we have never observed stars that lost even more shells and that could also explode.

FLORA LICHTMAN: So here’s what I understand. The missing shells get stripped off– not because of the supernova explosion, just because that can happen in a number of other ways. And then you have this stuff left behind.

STEVE SCHULZE: Right. For us, it was surprising that the star could essentially lose almost all of its shells, and we could just see at the very core or the very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">heart</span> of the star.

FLORA LICHTMAN: And what is that inner core that you’re looking at?

STEVE SCHULZE: OK, so what we found is that in the inner core, shells exist. And we found that there is an oxygen <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">silicon</span> shell. There were predictions that stars should have this kind of structure, but it was never observed. So this discovery was very important to confirm our existing models of how stars should form, how they should evolve.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Well, sounds nice to be right. First of all,

[LAUGHTER]

Is there anything about the finding that is rewriting what we thought we knew about stars?

STEVE SCHULZE: Well, one of the things that we observed is actually extremely puzzling. And this is the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">presence</span> of helium. This is an element that should have been consumed at a much earlier stage of the star’s life. So there should be no helium left. But we found helium, and this is very puzzling for us. And this is also not expected by any model. And we asked several people who study or who develop models for stars and how stars <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">evolve</span>, how they could explode. They all didn’t expect that there should still be helium, so it’s a huge mystery at the moment.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Are the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">theoretical</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">astrophysicists</span> happy about this or <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">annoyed</span>?

[LAUGHTER]

STEVE SCHULZE: Well, I think they would be very happy because now they can play with their models. They can see, OK, how can we tune them to match these <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">observations</span>. Maybe also be like, OK, well, maybe this type of star fits, or maybe none of the existing models fits them. We need something completely new. So it will be– I think it is very exciting for theoretical astrophysicists.

FLORA LICHTMAN: How do you that the outer layers got <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stripped</span> away instead of just got <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fused</span> into the heavier elements that you see?

STEVE SCHULZE: OK. So when a star is born, it is this huge ball of gas. And at the end of its life, it has this onion structure. And each layer of these shells in the onion have a particular chemical composition. Hydrogen on the outside, then helium, carbon oxygen, and so on. The material that is always in these shells, it cannot fuse further because in order to fuse elements you need high <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">densities</span>, you need high temperatures. And those conditions are not met in these shells.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Got it.

STEVE SCHULZE: So since we do not observe these elements in the spectra that we obtained, means that the star must have lost those shells a very long time ago.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Well, I was going to ask that. I mean, how long does it take for a star to die or to explode like this?

STEVE SCHULZE: This is a very good question. The evolution of stars is very, very complex, and it depends on various parameters. That can be maybe some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">abrupt</span> changes that can lead to huge changes in the evolution of a star.

In this particular case, we have some ideas of how this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">progenitor</span> star could have looked like or how it could have evolved, but we are not absolutely certain. Our leading <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hypothesis</span> is that the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">progenitor</span> star it was a very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">massive</span> star when it started to explode. And we think that it was so massive that the temperatures and the densities in the core were so huge that the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">photons</span> that live in the very cores, they fuse together and produce electron <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">positron</span> pairs.

And because the photons, they are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stabilizing</span> the star against the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gravitational</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">collapse</span>, this means then that if there are less photons, then the star contracts a little bit. And this could lead to some explosive nuclear fusion and– which can <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">liberate</span> a lot of energy. And we think that the star could have experienced this pair-<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">instability</span> a few times.

And what could happen then, is that you have this very massive star– we think it was around 60 solar masses shortly before it died. It experienced its first pair-<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">instability</span>, lost about 19 solar masses. So it’s a lot of material. And at the same time, it also <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">expelled</span> several of those shells. When the star <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ejected</span> so much material, it was just– it was almost at its breaking point. So it almost exploded. But it didn’t.

So it was a very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fluffy</span> object. And it, it took a few thousand years for it to start to contract again, start nuclear <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fusion</span> again. Then it experienced another of those pair-<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">instability</span> episodes, lost more material, contracts again, experiences this again. And with each of these new <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pulses</span>, it <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sheds</span> more material. And eventually it also loses some of this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">silicon</span>-rich material.

And the exact timescales are very uncertain because this depends on a lot of different factors. So maybe this is something that happened over the time span of a few thousand years. Maybe it could have also taken a bit longer. The exact timescales of this process in this object is unknown. And this is something that theoretical astrophysicists need to investigate in great detail. And this is very important to understand– what is 2021-YFJ and why it did what it did.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I love that. What comes next for you?

STEVE SCHULZE: So the next thing for us is a– to detect more objects. One object is not enough. We want to find similar objects. And then by studying more objects of the same type, we can get a better idea of their core properties. And also what was the most likely scenario for this type of explosion.

The other thing is that the supernova 2021-YFJ is such an extreme object, and the properties are so <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">starkly</span> different from the other supernova classes that we know, that we actually think there could be also– there could be other classes of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">supernovae</span> that we haven’t detected yet. So there might be now something like a gold rush moment, where we all try to find the missing link between the known supernova classes and this new supernova class that 2021-YFJ showed us.

FLORA LICHTMAN: This– the missing link of supernova. I love that. I think that’s the perfect place to land. Thanks, Steve.

STEVE SCHULZE: Thank you, Flora.
