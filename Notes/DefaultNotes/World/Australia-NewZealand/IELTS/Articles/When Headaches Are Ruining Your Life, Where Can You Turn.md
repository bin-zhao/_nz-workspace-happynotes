FLORA LICHTMAN: Hey, it’s Flora Lichtman. You’re listening to Science Friday.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Today in the podcast, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">headaches</span> are so common. But how well do we understand them?

TOM ZELLER JR.: It’s an invisible <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">disorder</span>. There’s no <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">biomarker</span>, there’s no test, there’s no scan you can do that will prove that I have this thing. And so a lot of it is just a high art of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">convincing</span> someone.

FLORA LICHTMAN: If you’ve ever had a headache– and you probably have– you know it is not pleasant. But maybe you pop some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ibuprofen</span>, and it goes away. But for many people, it’s not so simple. A headache isn’t just a one-off <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">annoyance</span>. It’s an experience you organize your life around, because these headaches could last for days, they’re so <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">painful</span> you can <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">barely</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">withstand</span> them, and they’re <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">largely</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">untreatable</span>.

That was the experience of my next guest, who went on a reporting <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">journey</span> to solve his own headache disorder, Tom <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Zeller</span> Jr., editor-in-<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">chief</span> of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Undark</span> and author of the new book _The Headache: The Science of a Most <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Confounding</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Affliction</span> and a Search for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Relief</span>_. He’s based in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Montana</span>. Tom, welcome to Science Friday.

TOM ZELLER JR.: It’s great to be here, Flora. Thanks for having me.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Let’s start with your personal story. When did the headache start for you?

TOM ZELLER JR.: Yeah. For me, they started in my early 20s, which is fairly typical for the flavor of headache that I get, the headache disorder I have, which is called cluster headache, and sort of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tormented</span> me for the next roughly 30 years. They are starting to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dissipate</span> as I get older, but it’s been a journey.

FLORA LICHTMAN: You write about in the book how hard it is to describe your own pain so that other people will understand it, but I’m going to ask you to do it again. What does it feel like for you?

TOM ZELLER JR.: Yeah. So, I mean, cluster headache, as a disorder, is interesting. It’s sometimes described even in the scientific <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">literature</span> as perhaps the most severe pain <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">syndrome</span> known to human beings. I think these sorts of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">comparisons</span> are hard to verify. But I can say it’s by far the most painful thing I ever experienced.

The pain comes on incredibly quickly, within seconds, without really much warning, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ratchets</span> up to a peak that there are times in my life where I’ve thought there couldn’t be anything that hurts this bad beyond this. So I liken the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intensity</span> of pain that you might get if you had your hand on a hot <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stove</span>, on a hot <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">burner</span>, but you can’t take it off for an hour or two.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Oh, man.

TOM ZELLER JR.: So every episode is kind of an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">emergency</span>. Unlike a lot of headache disorders, someone with cluster cannot sit still. You cannot speak. You’re often writhing on the ground. It’s not a very lovely thing to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">witness</span> or experience, I have to say.

FLORA LICHTMAN: And it must be just very difficult to have these sort of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">unpredictable</span> cluster headaches when you’re working or you’re at a workplace.

TOM ZELLER JR.: Yeah. Yeah. And I think that that’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">characteristic</span> of most people with a headache disorder, is you spend a lot of time, an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">inordinate</span> amount of time, arranging your life in order to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">endure</span> these things and still remain as <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">productive</span> as possible.

I’ll also say that cluster headache, unlike disorders that are probably more familiar to listeners like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">migraine</span>, come and go at a much higher frequency. So no individual attack tends to last more than an hour or two. So the headache comes, knocks you around, and then leaves. It’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">guaranteed</span> to come back again a few hours later or later in the day somewhere. You don’t when.

But you’re kind of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cured</span> between these headaches, whereas with a lot of disorders– and I spoke to a lot of these folks in the book who have migraine– you can be laid low for hours and hours and even days at a time with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">unrelenting</span> pain. So maybe the pain of a migraine is slightly less severe and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intense</span>, but it is a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">grinding</span> pain, I’m quite sure, and it lasts much longer.

FLORA LICHTMAN: You talk about your attempt to hide it, hide the condition. Can you talk about that?

TOM ZELLER JR.: Yeah. I mean, I think it’s something that most people with a headache disorder tend to learn, which is that, for good or ill, we use the word “headache” in a lot of ways in the English language, and we use it <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">metaphorically</span> to refer to things that are just kind of a minor <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">annoyance</span>. Doing your taxes are a headache or sitting in traffic as a headache.

Unfortunately, we use the same word and have the same word to describe a group of disorders that are true <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">neurobiological</span> disorders. And it can be hard culturally to navigate that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tension</span>. On the one hand, the same word is a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">punchline</span>. And on the other hand, it’s what my doctor is telling me I have. And so, yeah, you tend to hide it.

And there’s all kinds of cultural <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">baggage</span> that comes with that, too. There is a sense of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">malingering</span> that attaches to people who report having a headache too often, which is– I think a lot of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">migraineurs</span> experience this too, a sense that you’re using it as an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">excuse</span>. And so, yeah, I think that you learn that you probably <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ought</span> not invoke it very often. And if you can, you hide it.

FLORA LICHTMAN: OK, so what is causing the pain?

TOM ZELLER JR.: That’s the million dollar question, Flora. We don’t know exactly. I think the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">prevailing</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wisdom</span> for most of the 20th century– and in fact, going back many centuries– was that blood flow was somehow playing a role or that the basic <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">choreography</span> of a headache was that you had <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dilated</span> blood vessels somewhere in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cranial</span> anatomy, probably in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">meninges</span> or the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dural</span> layers that surround the brain, and probably because those are the most <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">innervated</span> parts of the head, too. So those blood vessels are getting <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">engorged</span>, possibly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">irritating</span> some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nociceptive</span> fibers there, sending signals to the brain, and causing pain.

But we’ve learned, probably more recently than we should, that that’s probably too simple, that there’s definitely a central nervous system component to this and maybe even the prime driver. So we know that certain parts of the brain are lighting up during the event. We know that certain <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">neurochemicals</span> are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">elevated</span> during the event. But what exactly is the prime mover in all that? And in the end, what is hurting? What anatomy is causing the pain? We don’t know, surprisingly.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Do we understand <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">migraines</span> any better?

TOM ZELLER JR.: No, no. In fact, I’m speaking of migraine most often because that’s the most studied headache disorder there is. So most of what we know about headaches comes from studying migraine itself. And no, we don’t know precisely. There’s a lot of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">debate</span> and discussion between schools of scientists who think that the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vasculature</span> still is a sort of important component in all this. And maybe it starts in the vasculature, and the central nervous system and brain are reacting to some event. Other scientists I spoke to feel it’s the complete opposite, that this is all sort of a central nervous system disease and that the blood vessels are just sort of extras in the whole <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">choreography</span> of it all.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Why don’t we understand this better?

TOM ZELLER JR.: Well, I think there are a lot of reasons behind it. I mean, one we already talked a little bit about. I think that it’s easy to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">diminish</span> the word “headache.” We didn’t take it seriously. And that cultural residue has been with us for a long time.

But I think there are other reasons, too. And it would not surprise listeners to know or to talk about the fact that women’s health in general has been given short shrift over–

FLORA LICHTMAN: We know it well.

TOM ZELLER JR.: –how many decades. Yes. So the fact that migraine, which is probably the most common headache disorder and is almost certainly outside the reach of most over-the-counter <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">medications</span>, and it occurs mostly in women by an order of, I think, 3 to 1. So I think the fact that women– and it’s not even a thing. I’m quite sure that the fact that most women were <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">presenting</span> in doctor’s offices with this and doctors reacting to it– you know, you need to relax more. You need to stop stressing.

These are things that were <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stated</span> in doctor’s offices and also written about in popular MD newspaper columns, that I could cure any migraine if a woman would just tell me what’s bothering her. Now, I can’t tell you how <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">infuriating</span> that must be to hear when you’re actually having a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">neurological</span> event.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I can picture it. I would be pretty– I am struggling for the radio-safe word right now. I’d be pretty angry. Yeah.

TOM ZELLER JR.: Yeah, there were a lot of women that I talked to who told me about experiencing similar things even today. There’s still this residue that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">invades</span> the clinic. And I think that that attitude towards these disorders has been a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">detriment</span> to the science and a detriment to all of us, not just women.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Do you feel like you were taken seriously when you went to doctors?

TOM ZELLER JR.: I document this a bit in the book. I think that I was listened to. I mean, the earliest doctors that I went to were– it was a primary care doctor, which is who most headache patients are going to encounter with these disorders, because there are far too few headache <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">specialists</span>, even among <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">neurologists</span>, if you can get in to see one. A very small percentage of them have had any special training in headache science or headache treatment.

So my encounters were usually with my primary care doctor, who didn’t really much about headache, but he was at least willing to listen. So I would bring him literature from the journals and say, hey, this is what we’re learning, or, hey, there’s this new <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">medication</span> out there. And he would sort of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shrug</span> and say, OK, let’s give it a go.

So in that sense, I think I was lucky. But I do think that as I moved from place to place and new doctor to new doctor, there were times when I had grown <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">weary</span> of having to explain myself again. You’ve had this disorder, and you come to a new doctor, and it’s sort of like you have to prove yourself, in some way, and becoming <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">convincing</span>.

It’s an invisible disorder. There’s no <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">biomarker</span>. There’s no test. There’s no scan you can do that will prove that I have this thing. And so a lot of it is just a high art of convincing someone.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I think anyone with a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">chronic</span> condition that’s hard to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">diagnose</span> and treat will relate to that.

TOM ZELLER JR.: Absolutely. Yeah, it’s very common.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

FLORA LICHTMAN: After the break, is headache science getting any more respect?

TOM ZELLER JR.: Almost every scientist that I spoke to who <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">devoted</span> their research life to headaches or to treating it in the clinic were told by <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mentors</span>, at the time they were going through school, do not waste your time on such a thing. It’s too <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">trivial</span>. You can’t help the patients. They’re <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hysterical</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Don’t go away.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

FLORA LICHTMAN: How many treatments did you try? And did you have any success with them?

TOM ZELLER JR.: The interesting thing that I learned– and I sort of knew it going into the book– is that there were very few, in fact no, real medications that had ever been developed and marketed specifically for a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">migraine</span> and certainly cluster headache disorder until 2018, which is incredibly recently. Before that, almost every other drug– in fact, for migraine, every single drug ever <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">prescribed</span>– was usually developed for some other disorder. And it just seemed off label to maybe help some people with their headaches so they would give it to you.

So most people were prescribed a variety of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">antidepressants</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">antiepileptics</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">anti-seizure</span> medications, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">steroids</span>. And they all had very, very powerful side effects that were almost sometimes worse than the disease itself.

There were, in the ’90s, the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">triptans</span>, which a lot of listeners may know. And they were pretty good at aborting a particular headache. So the drug classes are divided into <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">abortives</span>, which are used to silence a headache that’s happening. And then there are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">preventives</span> that would <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">supposedly</span> help to prevent the next headache from coming on.

The triptans were pretty good at aborting. The problem with it is that you couldn’t take it too often, because it could lead to a cycle of much more painful headaches. They call them <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rebound</span> headaches. So it wasn’t a perfect <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">remedy</span>. But that’s kind of what we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">muddled</span> through with for the last 30 years until these new class of drugs came out.

And these are pretty <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sophisticated</span> drugs. They’re called <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">CGRP</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">inhibitors</span>. CGRP is a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">neuropeptide</span> that’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">elevated</span> in the blood during a headache attack. And so the thinking was, well, what if we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">inhibited</span> this in some way? Would it help some people? And it got <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">FDA</span> approval in 2018, both for the prevention– first time a drug was designed for the prevention of migraine– and a year later for cluster headache. And you take it as an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">injection</span>.

And I’m not sure what the real-world <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">efficacy</span> rate is. I think most of these drugs, even the best ones, kind of eventually <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">settle</span> out at around half and half. So it works for about half of people. That’s still kind of a home run for a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pharmaceutical</span>.

An interesting thing about the CGRP drugs is that, for people who do <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">respond</span> to it, who do have the right sort of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">physiology</span> for this to work, respond <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">remarkably</span> well. And so I did talk to a lot of patients who had been just ground down by migraine headaches for the last 20 years suddenly can stop all drugs and just don’t have headaches at all. And it’s like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">awakenings</span>. I mean, they just sort of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">emerge</span> into a life that they’ve <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">forgotten</span> about.

And so it’s kind of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">miraculous</span> in that way. I took it, and I do think it probably helped me. Sometimes it’s hard to say, because when you feel a series of cluster attacks coming on, you tend to take all kinds of stuff. Like, I’ve got my magic little <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">herbal</span> sort of things that who knows if it does anything. I’ve tried <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">psilocybin</span>. And you might be taking any of these things at any given time, so it’s hard to prove what actually might have worked. But I think it worked. I think it worked for me.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Yeah, you talk about headache science as having this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reputation</span> for being a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">corner</span> of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">neurology</span> that’s like for the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">flunkies</span>. Is that changing?

TOM ZELLER JR.: I don’t think it’s changing. I think it’s changing somewhat. And I think, by having said this out loud in a book, maybe it’ll help to change somewhat. I don’t know. But I have to tell you, almost every scientist that I spoke to, particularly in the United States, who <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">devoted</span> their research life to headaches or to treating it in the clinic, were told by <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mentors</span>, at the time they were going through school, do not waste your time on such a thing. It’s too trivial. You can’t help the patients. They’re <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hysterical</span>. They’ll never– you’ll burn out. It’s just not worth your time. Do something that’s more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">swashbuckling</span> with your career. These are researchers at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Yale</span>, at the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Mayo</span> Clinic, at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">UCLA</span>, all of them the same message.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Not flunkies.

TOM ZELLER JR.: Not flunkies. No, no. But, also, they still, even decades after they’ve made that decision to spend their life doing it, are just amazed that that’s the way they were encouraged. And by the way, even in medical school, I talked to current students who say, yeah, we spend maybe about a half hour talking about headaches in all of medical school at all.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Wow.

TOM ZELLER JR.: Which is so strange because it’s so common, and you can imagine how much money you would <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">inject</span> back into the economy if you could just cure even half of them.

FLORA LICHTMAN: What do you want people to take away?

TOM ZELLER JR.: I mean, I’d love people to realize, even headache <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sufferers</span>, but particularly scientists and even funders, scientific funders, that what’s happening during these disorders is a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fascinating</span> neurological set of events that could actually teach us a lot about the basic <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">functioning</span> of the central nervous system if we bothered to pay attention to them enough.

You have such a huge population of people, most of whom are willing to submit to any sort of test or any sort of trial. And if we just spent a little more time paying attention to it, we actually might learn quite a lot about other disorders and a lot about the nature of pain itself. So there’s that.

And I also think that if a headache patient can step back a little bit between <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bouts</span>, it’s probably worth recognizing that there’s a lot of thought within the scientific community that these disorders are something that, in some way, confers a benefit. That sounds almost <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">counterintuitive</span>, but there’s not really a good explanation for why they <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">persist</span> in the human animal the way they do. They’ve been present such that we can tell in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">species</span>, in the same <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">proportion</span> for probably <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">millennia</span>.

So it doesn’t seem to be something that’s getting worse. It doesn’t seem to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">environmental</span>. It’s something <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hardwired</span> in some of us. And there’s some sense that, were there not some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ancillary</span> benefit to that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">trait</span>, it would have disappeared by now. So what is that? We don’t know. I mean, there are studies that look at whether or not there’s something <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">protective</span> with relation to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Alzheimer</span>’s. You can find some research on that. Not proven, purely <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">speculative</span>, but it’s being looked at.

There’s a sense that this is a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">manifestation</span> of central nervous system that’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">exquisitely</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">attuned</span> to the environment, which would have been incredibly useful in our species. A person with a headache disorder could actually imagine that what they have, even though it’s hard to think about it that way, is actually a benefit.

FLORA LICHTMAN: That’s quite <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fascinating</span>. Tom, thanks for sharing your story with us.

TOM ZELLER JR.: Hey, it’s been really great, and I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">appreciate</span> you taking an interest.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Tom Zeller Jr. editor-in-chief of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Undark</span> and author of the new book _The Headache: The Science of a Most Confounding Affliction and a Search for Relief_.
