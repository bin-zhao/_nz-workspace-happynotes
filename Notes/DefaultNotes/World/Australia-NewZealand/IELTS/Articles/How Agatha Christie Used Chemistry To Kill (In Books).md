FLORA LICHTMAN: This is Science Friday. I’m Flora Lichtman. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Perhaps</span> no other <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">author</span> has been more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">influential</span> in the crime-writing genre than the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Mistress</span> of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Mystery</span>, the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Duchess</span> of Death, the Queen of Crime, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Agatha</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Christie</span>.

She has sold billions of books. They’ve been translated into over 100 languages. But did you know that Agatha Christie had a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">chemistry</span> background? In about half her stories, poison is the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">murder</span> weapon of choice, something Christie knew a little bit about.

Dr. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Kathryn</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Harkup</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">chemist</span> turned author, explored those poisons in a new book, V is for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Venom</span>– Agatha Christie’s Chemicals of Death. Kathryn, welcome back to Science Friday.

KATHRYN HARKUP: Thank you for having me.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Kathryn, this is not your first book about poisons or even about Agatha Christie’s poisons. What has brought you back to this well?

KATHRYN HARKUP: Agatha Christie is so varied in her choice of poisons. Everyone seems to think it’s just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">arsenic</span> in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ubiquitous</span> cups of tea served at the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vicar</span>’s table. It’s not that.

She is so <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">imaginative</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">creative</span>, not just in the choice of poisons, but how they’re <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">deployed</span>, how they’re <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">detected</span>, how signs are signaled to her readers and other characters within the book. So I had more than enough material to fill one book.

FLORA LICHTMAN: And you must love writing about the science of killing people.

KATHRYN HARKUP: Oh, who wouldn’t?

FLORA LICHTMAN: OK. [LAUGHS] Well, how <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">accurate</span> is the poison science in Agatha Christie’s books?

KATHRYN HARKUP: I have to say, she is top <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">notch</span>. You really have to be quite <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">picky</span> to find <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fault</span> in her use of poisons. There are certain examples where she speeds up the effects or she <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">exaggerates</span> the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">detectability</span>, perhaps.

But you can understand that, for the purposes of a story, nobody wants to read about eight hours of agonizing <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stomach</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cramps</span>. We want to get on with the plot. So I can understand some of the shortcuts. But generally speaking, she is absolutely top quality in her scientific <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">accuracy</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Where did she learn about poisons?

KATHRYN HARKUP: She trained during the First World War to be a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dispenser</span> in a hospital <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dispensary</span>. So she was making up drugs and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">prescriptions</span> by hand because there was nothing pre-packaged, pre-weighed, in the 1910s when the war was going on.

So she just was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">surrounded</span> by bottles of poisons that you had to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">accurately</span> weigh out, mix together, effectively press into <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pills</span> that would hold their shape long enough in the bottle but <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">disintegrate</span> in the body to release their active component. So there is a technical skill in knowing what drugs can and can’t be combined. But there is also an art in being able to blend and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mix</span> these compounds into usable products.

And because the risk of giving someone too much or the wrong drug is very high and it has very serious consequences, obviously, you have to study very hard. You have to what you’re doing. So she had a very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">thorough</span> background, not just in chemistry, but in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pharmacy</span>, as well as shadowing another <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pharmacist</span> to understand the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">practicalities</span> of this particular job.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I mean, there were so many medical and science advances during Agatha Christie’s time. Is there any <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">evidence</span> that she was keeping up with this?

KATHRYN HARKUP: Oh, absolutely. I would say perhaps one of the best examples is her use of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bacterial</span> poisons. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Bacteria</span> are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">superb</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">poisoners</span>. They’ve had millions of years to evolve very deadly, very specific <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">toxins</span>, that enable them to live, grow, multiply.

And she understood that there was a real <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">threat</span> if someone got an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">infection</span>, and there was a very good chance that they would die. Our ability to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fend</span> off bacteria is only really a century old. Less, really. And <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Christie</span> wrote about the use of bacteria poisons as a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">deliberate</span> murder weapon pre-Second World War.

She didn’t use it after the Second World War, probably because she realized that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">antibiotics</span> gave her <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">victims</span> a very good chance of surviving, which is great for the victim. It’s not so good when you’re trying to plot a murder mystery.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Wow. Do you think that the scientific accuracy made the book stronger?

KATHRYN HARKUP: I think so. I mean, she has no <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">obligation</span> to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">scientifically</span> accurate. This is an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">invented</span> world. She can be as creative, as <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fictitious</span>, as she wants to be. I think most readers will forgive almost anything within a story as long as it follows its own internal logic.

But to someone who <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">appreciates</span> how <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">accurate</span> it is, I think it makes it that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">extra</span> special good. One of her favorite or her most <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cherished</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">compliments</span> that she received was a review by a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pharmaceutical</span> journal that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">complimented</span> her on the accurate uses of poisons.

FLORA LICHTMAN: [LAUGHS] Of all the reviews.

KATHRYN HARKUP: Of all the reviews, just to say not whether the story was good or bad, but the use of poisons was accurate.

FLORA LICHTMAN: [LAUGHS] In your book, we learn a lot about different poisons. And I was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">curious</span> about your target audience. Are you going for Agatha Christie <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">diehards</span>, chemistry <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nerds</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">serial</span> killers?

KATHRYN HARKUP: In a very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">selfish</span> way, I’m going for absolutely anybody that wants to buy my book.

FLORA LICHTMAN: [LAUGHS]

KATHRYN HARKUP: So I–

FLORA LICHTMAN: Of course, certainly.

KATHRYN HARKUP: I’m very happy to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cater</span> to Agatha Christie <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fans</span>, science fans. But this is not a how-to guide. You are not going to get very far using my book as a method of planning your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">future</span> murder.

So there are key bits of information that are missing, I’m sorry to say. Even if you are successful in your murder, you are going to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">caught</span>. And it’s very difficult to explain why you have this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">well-thumbed</span> edition of my book on your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bookshelves</span> with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">passages</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">underlined</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: OK, so why do you think poison captures the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">imagination</span>? What makes it good for one of these stories?

KATHRYN HARKUP: It is an incredibly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">devious</span> method of murder. The idea of poisoning, you have to think about this. You really have to plan it. You can’t just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lash</span> out with poison. You have to figure out how you’re going to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">obtain</span> it, how you’re going to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">administer</span> it, also, what you’re going to do <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">whilst</span> you’re waiting around for it to take effect.

So there’s a lot of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">opportunities</span> to think about what you’re doing and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reconsider</span>. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Murderers</span> that use poison, they’ve got this kind of extra layer of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nastiness</span> to their <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">personality</span>, just because they’ve really thought about this and continued with it.

FLORA LICHTMAN: What’s your favorite poison?

KATHRYN HARKUP: Oh, it changes all the time. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Honestly</span>–

FLORA LICHTMAN: A poison for every season.

KATHRYN HARKUP: A poison for every season, every <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">occasion</span>, every <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mood</span>. I get asked quite a bit, what poison would you use to kill someone? I’m obviously not going to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">divulge</span> that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">publicly</span>, so I have to step around it.

And I have to explain to people that, obviously, I would <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tailor</span> my poison to my victim, because what you absolutely have to do is avoid the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">autopsy</span>. The people who do <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">autopsies</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">forensic</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">toxicologists</span>, they are superb at their job. And they are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tenacious</span> in finding those killer substances, which means you’ve got to make your murder look like natural causes or an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">accident</span>.

So you’re going to have to have a complete medical history. You’re looking for pre-existing conditions. And you’ve got to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tailor</span> your poisons to produce those <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">symptoms</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I think people are familiar with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nightshade</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hemlock</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">arsenic</span>. But are there <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lesser</span>-known poisons that you feel like don’t get the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">limelight</span>, but really should?

[LAUGHTER]

KATHRYN HARKUP: Don’t get the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">publicity</span> that they really <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">deserve</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Yeah.

KATHRYN HARKUP: [LAUGHS] What I try to get across to lots of people that I talk to about poisons is that poison is just the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dose</span>. Literally anything can be a poison if you give someone too much of something. So you can kill someone by giving them too much water.

It takes a lot of water. They will notice and try and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">resist</span>. So most poisons, most things that people think of as poisons, are toxic in very small <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">quantities</span>. Having said that, there are all sorts of compounds that are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">surprisingly</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">toxic</span> if you take a relatively small amount.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Such as?

KATHRYN HARKUP: So one of the ones that– one of the ones I particularly enjoyed researching for this book was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nitroglycerin</span>, because we all it as an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">explosive</span>. This is what <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Alfred</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Nobel</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tamed</span> and put into <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dynamite</span>. This is how Alfred Nobel made his <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fortune</span> and was able to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bequeath</span> these awards for the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">betterment</span> of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">humanity</span> through scientific <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">endeavors</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">literature</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">peace</span>.

But this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nitroglycerin</span> is also a very good medicine because it doesn’t just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">disintegrate</span> very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rapidly</span> to cause an explosion. It will disintegrate in the body to release, very slowly, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nitrous</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">oxide</span>, which <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dilates</span> your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">veins</span> and your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">arteries</span>. So if you have a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">constriction</span> in the arteries feeding into your heart, then it can open them up.

So it is a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">brilliant</span> drug. But obviously, if you take too much of it, you can <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dilate</span> those <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vessels</span> so much that you get a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">catastrophic</span> fall in blood pressure.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Agatha Christie kills off a few people with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">digitalis</span>.

KATHRYN HARKUP: Yes.

FLORA LICHTMAN: And I recognize it from the movie <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Casino</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Royale</span>, where <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Daniel</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Craig</span>, as James <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Bond</span>, is playing <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">poker</span> when he realizes his <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">martini</span> was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">laced</span>.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

– Who is it?

– 007.

– Bond’s been poisoned. He’s going into <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cardiac</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">arrest</span>.

– Stay <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">calm</span> and don’t <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">interrupt</span>, because you’ll be dead within two minutes unless you do exactly what I tell you.

– I’m all ears.

[END PLAYBACK]

FLORA LICHTMAN: What is it? What is digitalis?

KATHRYN HARKUP: So digitalis is– the technical name is a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cardiac</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">glycoside</span>. So the cardiac bit is the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">clue</span>. It affects the heart. There are several compounds within <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">foxgloves</span> that produce an effect on the heart. And several of them have been <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">isolated</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">purified</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">formulated</span> as heart drugs.

They slow down heartbeat so you get slower, more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intense</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">contractions</span> of your heart. So if you have a rapid, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fluttering</span> heartbeat that is not efficiently <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pumping</span> blood around your body, digitalis can slow that down, coordinate it, so the blood moves around your body, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">delivering</span> oxygen in the way that it needs to. Obviously, if you have too much, you can slow down the heart to the point that it stops, or you push it the other way and you <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">disrupt</span> that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">coordination</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: So Bond’s team says he has two minutes to intervene or he’ll die. Does digitalis act that fast?

KATHRYN HARKUP: Yeah. I mean, he does very quickly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stagger</span> to the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bathroom</span> to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vomit</span> and try and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">get rid of</span> as much poison as possible. But obviously, he doesn’t get rid of it all. And he then staggers out to the car park where he’s got a complete medical <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">suite</span> just in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">glove</span> box of his car.

So it would normally take a little longer to maybe take effect on the body. But this is a fast-<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">paced</span> film, so, of course, they speed things up. But <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ultimately</span>, it’s a very quick <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">trip</span> to the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">morgue</span> if your heart stops beating.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">foxglove</span> in my <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">garden</span>.

KATHRYN HARKUP: Yeah, so do I.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Is it the very same?

KATHRYN HARKUP: Yes.

FLORA LICHTMAN: So if I ground up the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">petals</span> or something, what–

KATHRYN HARKUP: Oh, don’t make tea out of foxglove leaves. No. That’s a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">terrible</span> idea. Don’t do that.

FLORA LICHTMAN: OK. [LAUGHS] OK. Are there many <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">antidotes</span> for poison?

KATHRYN HARKUP: There are quite a few antidotes. There are quite a few poisons that do have very specific antidotes. For example, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">opiates</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">morphine</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">heroin</span>, drugs like that, they interact with quite specific <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">receptors</span>.

So the antidotes are chemicals that lock into those same <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">receptors</span> but don’t activate them. So they literally just push the drug out of the way. So the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">counteracting</span> of the effects of the drug is almost instant. It is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lifesaving</span> for people who have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">overdosed</span>. So that’s a really specific example of an antidote.

An <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">awful</span> lot of poisons, however, when you turn up in an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">emergency</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ward</span>, they will treat symptoms. So if your heart is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">racing</span>, they will give you a drug that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">calms</span> your heart. If your heart is slow, they will give you a drug that increases the heart rate.

And they will treat symptoms as they <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">present</span> themselves until the body is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stabilized</span>. It’s about keeping the patient <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">alive</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">comfortable</span> until the body can <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">naturally</span> break down that poison and get rid of it.

FLORA LICHTMAN: You’re listening to Science Friday from WNYC studios. We’re talking about the science of poison. Happy <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">summer</span> to you, with Kathryn Harkup. Can you build a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tolerance</span> for poison?

KATHRYN HARKUP: Ooh, depends on the poison. So if you’re thinking about something like the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Dorothy</span> L. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Sayers</span> story, Strong Poison, where two people eat an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">arsenic</span>-laced dinner, and one person survives and the other person doesn’t because, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spoiler</span>, they’ve kind of prepared themselves by eating little doses of arsenic, that won’t work. I’m afraid you’re both <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">goners</span>.

But the science at the time was absolutely spot on. It’s just that the science has discovered more. We have moved on.

FLORA LICHTMAN: So Agatha Christie died in the ’70s. Do you think that murderers could use those same poisons now and get away with it?

KATHRYN HARKUP: Generally speaking, no. The poisons that Agatha Christie used, they date her novels as much as the clothes, the conversation, the cars, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">et cetera</span>, et cetera. Because a lot of the poisons, what we call poisons now, were part of medicine. And this is how she knew about them. But medicine has developed safer <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">alternatives</span> to a lot of these drugs, so you simply can’t get hold of the kind of compounds Agatha Christie was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dealing</span> with.

Secondly, medical care has improved <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dramatically</span>, so you are more likely to survive if you have been poisoned with some of these substances. And thirdly, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">forensic</span> detection is also much, much better, so you are far less likely to get away with it.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I want to get into your head a little bit. Are you, having written these books, just constantly scanning the room for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">suspicious</span> plants? Has this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">infected</span> your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">outlook</span>?

KATHRYN HARKUP: Um. [SIGHS] I would like to say no.

[LAUGHTER]

There was an occasion where I went to a coffee shop with a friend. And it was a lovely coffee shop that had fresh flowers on top of their little cake display. And I looked at the fresh flowers one day, and they had a particularly toxic plant that had been picked and put into a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vase</span>.

And I very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stupidly</span> asked the person behind the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">counter</span> if they were real or if they were <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fake</span>. And this particular toxic plant, you can <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">absorb</span> the poison through your skin. And to my <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shame</span>, she <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rubbed</span> the leaves with her fingers to confirm that it was a real plant. So I didn’t have–

FLORA LICHTMAN: That’s on you.

KATHRYN HARKUP: I thought twice about where certain flowers end up.

FLORA LICHTMAN: What’s your next book? Are you staying on the murder train?

KATHRYN HARKUP: I’m afraid I am stuck on the murder train. The next book I am currently researching, and I’m going through the very worst of humanity at the moment, I am writing a book on how to get away with murder or how not to get away with murder.

FLORA LICHTMAN: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Delightful</span>. Kathryn, thanks for joining me today.

KATHRYN HARKUP: Thank you.
