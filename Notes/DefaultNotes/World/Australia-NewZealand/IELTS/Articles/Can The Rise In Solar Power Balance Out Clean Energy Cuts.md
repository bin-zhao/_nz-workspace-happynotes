IRA FLATOW: This is Science Friday. I’m Ira Flatow. Since President Trump returned to office, his administration has been <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">aggressive</span> in rolling back clean energy <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">initiatives</span>. Trump’s Big, Beautiful <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Bill</span> ended tax <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">credits</span> for solar panels and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">electric</span> vehicles. And according to reporting from The New York Times this week, the EPA is moving to cancel $7 billion in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">federal</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">grants</span> that were intended to help low and middle-income families install solar on their homes.

But that isn’t the whole story because <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Texas</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">California</span>, and other states are bringing so much solar and battery power online that in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">March</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fossil</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fuels</span> generated less than half the electricity in the US for the first time ever. And <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">internationally</span>, solar has gotten so cheap to build and install that it’s fundamentally transforming many countries’ power <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">grids</span>.

So <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">despite</span> all the clean energy <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rollbacks</span> on this side of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pond</span>, where exactly does solar <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">adoption</span> stand in the US and across the world right now? Do we still need the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">defunct</span> solar tax credits? And is it enough to have a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">meaningful</span> impact on our climate? Climate <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">activist</span> Bill <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">McKibben</span> has written all about this in his new book, Here Comes the Sun– A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Civilization</span>. Bill is based in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Middlebury</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Vermont</span>. Bill, always welcome back to the show. Nice to have you.

BILL MCKIBBEN: It’s always good to get to talk with you, Ira, over the years.

IRA FLATOW: Thank you. All right, let’s get into it. Is this rapid world adoption of solar surprising to you?

BILL MCKIBBEN: It’s what we’ve been hoping for, for a very long time. But it’s happening very fast. You’ll <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">recall</span> that June 2023 was the month that climate scientists really started <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">freaking</span> out about this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sudden</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spike</span> in temperatures. They said we were seeing the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hottest</span> temperatures in the last 125,000 years. And every month since then has been the hottest <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">August</span>, the second hottest <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">June</span>, whatever.

That same month, June 2023, was the moment when human beings started installing a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gigawatt</span>’s worth of solar panels, which is like a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">coal</span>-fired power plant’s worth of solar panels every day. It took us from 1954 until 2022 to put up the first <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">terawatt</span> of solar panels in this world. The second terawatt came within about two years. And the third will happen before this year is out.

So this is a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tremendous</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">surge</span> finally. And it’s the first thing in the 35 years or so that I’ve been working on the climate <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crisis</span>, that we have anything that’s scaling fast enough to potentially make some kind of difference in how hot the Earth eventually gets.

IRA FLATOW: So solar is then the fastest growing energy right now.

BILL MCKIBBEN: Fastest growing energy right now and the fastest growing energy source in the history of energy. Look, we miss it <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">somewhat</span> because much of the growth is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">concentrated</span> elsewhere. China is the great example. In May, China was putting up three gigawatts’ worth of solar every day, three coal-fired power plants’ worth of solar.

We have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">petro</span> states in this world, but China is the first <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">electro</span> state that we have on planet Earth. And there’s so much capacity there that it’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">leaking</span> over into its <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">neighbors</span> and trading networks. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Pakistan</span> next door, people there last year, without any <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">guidance</span> from the government and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">relying</span> mostly on TikTok videos for technical help, put up the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">equivalent</span> of half the country’s electric grid in solar panels just on <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rooftops</span>. If you go look at Google Earth for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Lahore</span> or <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Karachi</span> or <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Islamabad</span>, it’s like watching mushrooms spread after a rain.

IRA FLATOW: And states here in the United States aren’t doing too badly. I’m talking about Texas and California. We’ve seen tremendous growth there, right?

BILL MCKIBBEN: Start with California, which is the place that took this most seriously. California has put up enough solar panels and, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crucially</span>, enough batteries over the last couple of years that they’ve hit some kind of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tipping</span> point, Ira. Most days now, almost every day, California produces more than 100% of the electricity it uses from renewable sources for long periods, which means that at night, when the sun goes down, the biggest source of supply to their grid is usually batteries that have spent the afternoon <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">soaking</span> up <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">excess</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sunshine</span>.

The bottom line– and this is the most encouraging statistic I’ve heard in those decades of working on climate– is that California, fourth largest economy on planet Earth, is using 40% less natural gas to produce electricity this year than it did two years ago. That’s the kind of number, that if we spread it around the world, would make a difference in how hot the Earth gets.

And it’s not just California. As you point out, Texas is now putting up renewable energy and batteries faster than any place else in the country, not, obviously, out of any <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ideological</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">commitment</span> or any deep concern for climate. They’re doing it because the economics and the desire for a stable grid are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">outweighing</span> even the best efforts of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hydrocarbon</span> lobby in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Houston</span> to convince the state <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">legislature</span> to do otherwise.

IRA FLATOW: But most of the solar panels in the world come from China, right? They’re the–

BILL MCKIBBEN: Yep.

IRA FLATOW: –the champion of solar panel makers. What about the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tariffs</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">imposed</span> on China now? Is that going to cut back the use of them?

BILL MCKIBBEN: That’ll definitely <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">divert</span> a lot of those panels to other places, who will get the benefit of the cheap energy they provide. For climate purposes, we need to convert everyone. And of course, what President <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Biden</span> tried to do with the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Inflation</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Reduction</span> Act was to make America a producer of solar panels, too, with some success. The biggest solar panel factory in the US now is, in all places, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Marjorie</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Taylor</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Greene</span>’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">district</span> in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Georgia</span>.

So they did their best. But the scare that all of this put into the fossil fuel industry <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">motivated</span> them to do everything they could to game our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">political</span> system. You’ll recall, about this time last year, then-candidate Trump telling the fossil fuel industry that for $1 billion in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">campaign</span> donations, they could have absolutely anything they wanted.

The industry came through with about a half billion dollars in donations, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">advertising</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lobbying</span> during the last <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">election</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cycle</span>. And that proves to have been <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">plenty</span> because they’re getting every possible thing that they could from the Trump administration. I don’t think that it will be enough to reverse the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">momentum</span>, certainly, not in the rest of the world.

But of course, the problem is that it comes at a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crucial</span> moment. We have very limited time to deal with the climate <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crisis</span>, as you know better than just about any <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">journalist</span> on the planet, because you’ve been covering it so <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">faithfully</span> for so long. The <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Intergovernmental</span> Panel on Climate Change told us a couple of years ago that to stay on a path, anything like the one we set in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Paris</span>, we’d need to cut emissions in half by 2030, which, by my watch, is four years and six months away, not leaving us a great deal of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">margin</span>.

So along with everything else, in this country, we’re going to have to make the case again for renewable energy. We’re having a big <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nationwide</span> day of action on the fall <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">equinox</span>, September 21, that we’re calling not Earth Day, but Sun Day. And the point of it, Ira, is to drive home something that I think really needs to get through people’s heads.

This is no longer the Whole Foods of energy– nice, but <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pricey</span>. This is the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Costco</span> of energy. It’s cheap. It’s available in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bulk</span>. It’s on the shelf, ready to go. We live on a planet where the cheapest way to make power is to point a sheet of glass at the sun. That is an incredibly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">liberating</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">notion</span>, for all kinds of reasons, right down to the fact that even human beings are going to be hard-pressed to figure out how to fight a war over sunshine. If we can get this done, then we live in a different world on the other side.

IRA FLATOW: Speaking of the Costco of energy, are we going to see the day soon when you might be able to go into a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">big-box store</span> and say, I’ll order some solar panels, put them on my roof? Because it’s not that easy. Right? In other countries–

BILL MCKIBBEN: Yep.

IRA FLATOW: –you can do that. Right? You can’t do that here yet.

BILL MCKIBBEN: Absolutely. In <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Germany</span>, for instance, you can walk into whatever the equivalent of Best Buy is and walk out with a few hundred <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">euros</span>’ worth of solar panel that are designed to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hung</span> over the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">railing</span> on your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">porch</span> or <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">veranda</span>. This is called <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">balcony</span> solar. And last year, a million and a half Germans did just this– put up that big panel off their <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">balcony</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">plugged</span> it into the wall, and in many cases, were providing 20% or more of the energy that they were using.

That’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">illegal</span> everywhere in this country, except the state of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Utah</span>, where the deep red legislature this year <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">unanimously</span> passed enabling <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">legislation</span> saying, if you’ve got an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">apartment</span> here, go ahead and put it up. We’re going to need a lot more of that kind of thing. Rooftop solar, in general, for people’s homes is three times more expensive in America than it is in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Australia</span> or the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">EU</span>.

A little bit of that is the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tariffs</span> on the panels, but most of it is the fact that you have to get all these <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">permits</span>, and they come from 10,000 different <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">jurisdictions</span>. Each city and town has its own set of rules. And that is the thing, more than anything else, that delays and drives up the time. If you’re in Australia, you can call up on a Monday and say, I want solar panels on my roof, and by <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Wednesday</span>, they’re up there and producing energy. And as a result, 40% of the homes in Australia have solar panels on the roof.

IRA FLATOW: Is there any way to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">streamline</span> all this permitting?

BILL MCKIBBEN: There sure is. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">The National Renewable Energies Lab</span> a few years ago came up with an app, which they call Solar App Plus. And happily, since they’re now under attack by <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">DOGE</span>, they managed to spin it off into a non-profit. And so far, California, Maryland, and a few weeks ago, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">New Jersey</span>, have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mandated</span> the use of this Solar App Plus for rooftop <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">installers</span>. And it means that in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">essence</span>, they can get an automatic permit right away.

And that’s a big step towards speeding up this process. One of the things we’re doing at Sun Day is encouraging lots and lots and lots of other jurisdictions to do the same thing. We can’t get much done in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Washington</span> at the moment for obvious reasons, but that leaves lots and lots of states, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">legislators</span>, and city <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">halls</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">county</span> boards where we think we can get reason to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">prevail</span>.

IRA FLATOW: As I drive around, I see more and more farmers installing solar panels. And I’m reminded of on our show, about 25 years ago, when people started installing wind farms. I talked to a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rancher</span> in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Oklahoma</span> who was telling me that he’s making more money on his <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ranch</span> from his limited wind farm, his <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">turbines</span> on there than he is from raising <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cattle</span>. [LAUGHS] And that seems to be taking place with solar now.

BILL MCKIBBEN: For farmers, it’s often the difference between making a profit and not because for two reasons. One, you can get a good <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">steady</span> price for energy, many, many locked in many years into the future. But you can also– and this is a beautiful part of this story– do what’s called <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">agrivoltaics</span>. You can grow food and produce <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">electrons</span> on the same field.

And in fact, in an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">overheating</span> world, Ira, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shade</span> is becoming an increasingly important <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">commodity</span>, including for farmers. I just was looking at the studies from a bunch of trials from Europe. They were finding things like increase in yields for wine <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">grapes</span> of 60%.

I spent some time in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Vermont</span> last year with people who are taking many of the solar farms in my home state and planting <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pollinator</span>-friendly plants in between the rows. These are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">attracting</span> orders of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">magnitude</span> more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pollinators</span> than you’d find in a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cornfield</span>. And as a result, the farmers in the neighboring <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">orchards</span> are reporting that fruit set is up 30%, 40%, just because there’s suddenly all the pollinators that we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">desperately</span> need. They’re figuring out how to deal with the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">biodiversity</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crisis</span> at the same time that they take on the climate crisis.

So there are beautiful <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">possibilities</span> here. The only <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">caveat</span>, again, is that we have to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">seize</span> them quickly. We’re going to run this world on sun and wind in 40 years, just from <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sheer</span> economics. But if it takes us anything like 40 years to get there, then the planet we run on sun and wind is going to be a broken planet.

You know the science that’s coming out every week now about what’s happening with the ability of the Earth’s atmosphere to hold <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">devastating</span> amounts of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">moisture</span> that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pour</span> down in the kind of floods we’re now seeing. We have to do this more quickly than economics alone will <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dictate</span> because we’re deep in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">midst</span> of this climate crisis.

IRA FLATOW: And you’ve anticipated my last question here, Bill. Because you write in your book that the rate of international solar adoption in the last two years is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">exponential</span>. But is it enough to make a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">noticeable</span> difference on the actual effects of climate change that we’re experiencing now?

BILL MCKIBBEN: If we do what we’re capable of doing, then the answer is yes. It’s not going to stop global warming. That’s no longer on the menu. But remember, each <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tenth</span> of a degree <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Celsius</span> that we raise the temperature moves another 100 million human beings out of a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">climatically</span> comfortable zone. So what we can do is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">arrest</span> the rise in temperature somewhere short of where it’s currently headed. And degree that we can do that is an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">extraordinary</span> gift to the people who will come after us.

That’s why this moment is so powerful. We have finally, in our hands, a tool that allows us to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">deflect</span> what otherwise is the kind of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">apocalyptic</span> course that we find ourselves on. By God, Ira, we need to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">seize</span> it and seize it as fast and as hard as we can.

IRA FLATOW: Bill, remind us when Sun Day is coming up.

BILL MCKIBBEN: Sun Day is coming up on <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">September</span> 21. Sunday.earth is the place to join in.

IRA FLATOW: There you have it. Bill, as always, thank you for taking time to visit and share with us your new book. It’s a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">terrific</span> book.

BILL MCKIBBEN: Thank you for talking– and more to the point, Ira, I just want to say, thank you for paying serious attention to this for decades. Very few people did for a long time, and I’ll always be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">grateful</span> for your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">leadership</span> on all of this.

IRA FLATOW: You’re welcome. As we say, if not now, when? Bill McKibben, author of the new book, Here Comes the Sun– A Last Chance for the Climate and a Fresh Chance for Civilization.
