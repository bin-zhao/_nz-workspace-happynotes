JIM LOVELL: That’s when we got to be– starting to worry about whether we would ever get home again.

IRA FLATOW: We’re remembering James Lovell, commander of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ill-fated</span> Apollo 13 flight. He died last week at the age of 97. I have done thousands of interviews on this program, but some, like this one, really <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stick with me</span>.

Back in 1995, I had the chance for a long conversation with Lovell. It was the week of the 25th <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">anniversary</span> of their <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">historic</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nail-biting</span> flight and the safe return to Earth. I think you’ll agree it still holds its drama 30 years later.

There are certain dramatic events one remembers very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vividly</span>, like remembering where you were when you heard the news about <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Kennedy</span> or King. Well, for me, Apollo 13 falls into that category too. I’ll never forget that night.

I was home in bed around 11 o’clock, 10, 11 o’clock at night, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">glued</span> to the radio, listening <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sleepless</span> to a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">heart-pumping</span> drama that would play out all night, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">awaiting</span> news about the lives of three people I had never even met before, who were cast <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">adrift</span> in a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lifeboat</span> with no hope for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rescue</span> from any other ship nearby but with the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">slim</span> possibility that if they were lucky and smart and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sprung</span> no leaks, their lifeboat would find its way home.

But first it had to cross a huge ocean, perform in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">uncharted</span> waters, and survive a fate that no other ship before it had ever faced. It seems just like yesterday.

And the command <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pilot</span> who had twice attempted to set foot on the moon and who was twice denied the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">opportunity</span>, Jim Lovell, is my guest here today. He joins us by phone from his hotel in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Costa</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Mesa</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">California</span>. Welcome to the program.

JIM LOVELL: Good morning, Ira. How are you?

IRA FLATOW: Fine.

JIM LOVELL: Well, it’s afternoon now.

IRA FLATOW: Well, wherever you are– you know what <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Einstein</span> says. What are you up to these days?

JIM LOVELL: Well, last night I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">attended</span> the 25th anniversary of the Apollo 13 <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">incident</span>. And we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">celebrated</span> on the 13th, which was what we call <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Boom</span> Day.

IRA FLATOW: [LAUGHS] Is there a sort of a black <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">humor</span> about this now?

JIM LOVELL: Well, you have to have a little humor in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tight</span> situations.

IRA FLATOW: You weren’t very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">humorous</span> in those– back 25 years ago on that night, were you?

JIM LOVELL: No, I was a little <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">apprehensive</span>, a little <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">frustrated</span>, just about everything.

IRA FLATOW: Did you really, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">in your heart of hearts</span>, believe you were going to get out of that situation?

JIM LOVELL: Well, when the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">explosion</span> first <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">occurred</span>, we didn’t know the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">severity</span> of it because we were losing fuel cells. But one fuel cell would have been <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sufficient</span> for us to get home.

And then we saw the oxygen going out. Then we knew that the third fuel cell would die. And then <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pretty</span> soon, the whole command module would <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">collapse</span> on us. And that’s when we got to be– starting to worry about whether we would ever get home again.

IRA FLATOW: You’ve said that if the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">explosion</span> had happened earlier or later, you and the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crew</span> would not have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">survived</span>. Why is that?

JIM LOVELL: That’s true. If the explosion <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">occurred</span> just after we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">committed</span> ourselves to leave the Earth and go to the moon, we would not have had enough battery power in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lunar</span> module to make that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">transit</span> all the way around the moon. And we could not turn back because we had no ability to fire our command module’s engines because we lost all the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">electrical</span> power.

Had this explosion occurred after we were orbiting the moon and we had detached to go down to the lunar surface, we would not have had enough fuel in the lunar module once we got back up to get out of lunar orbit and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">propel</span> ourselves back to the Earth.

IRA FLATOW: So that was really the only lucky part of the mission.

JIM LOVELL: Yes, it was very, very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fortunate</span> that if we were going to have an explosion to have it at that time.

IRA FLATOW: Three big men were able to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">squeeze</span> into a little lunar module equipped for two people that was only designed for two people for two days. The story of how you got enough air to breathe and water and food to live on is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fascinating</span>. What did you have to do to turn that into a lifeboat?

JIM LOVELL: Well, we had to do several things. First of all, we had to use its <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">propulsion</span> system to re-establish the proper course on the way home. Then we had to use the same propulsion system to speed up our return home, because as you mentioned, that vehicle was designed only for 45 hours and two people.

And as I looked around, I counted three. And I didn’t want to be left behind. So I thought we’d better stretch it out. And also we had to use its <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">guidance</span> system for a while, so we had to transfer all that guidance information from the dying command module into the lunar module.

And since the temperature was dropping anyway, it was kind of crowded. But our body <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">warmth</span> kept us comfortable just a little bit.

IRA FLATOW: The space program of the last 40 years is always filled with defining moments when something happens and a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">technician</span> or an engineer or somebody makes that incredible decision about to go or not to go or to do something. What was that moment on your flight?

JIM LOVELL: Well, there were several moments because we had <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crises</span> to overcome all the way home. I think the first critical decision was the crew’s decision to get into the lunar module, which came quite a bit earlier than when the ground finally realized that we did have all these things going wrong with us.

And we got in there and turned on those systems with just enough time to transfer the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">guidance</span> information. That was the first critical. The second one was a ground decision that says, let’s get them back on that free return course again. And they did that.

The third one was a decision that was not a hard one to decide, but Haise came up and said, we don’t have enough battery power in the lunar module to get home. And the ground agreed at the same time.

And then they said they think we have a solution. And that was their decision, to burn the engine for a second time for a long period of time after we passed the back of the moon.

And of course, the final decision was to again <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">readjust</span> our course, which was necessary. But we had to do that by the seat of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pants</span>, because we had turned off all those <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">exotic</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">electronic</span> devices to help us <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">navigate</span>.

See, we had our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">navigation</span> equipment in the command module. We had very similar equipment in the lunar module. And we held those two <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mated</span> together all the way home.

But after we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lit</span> our engine for the second time and had it on for about 4.5 minutes, then we shut everything down to save electrical power so that we’d have enough power to keep control of the vehicle all the way home.

And when we did that, we had to turn off all the exotic electronic <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">navigational</span> equipment. So we lost, in the memory of the computer, the position of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">navigable</span> stars. And we turned off the guidance system so the platform went down. The <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">autopilot</span> wouldn’t work anymore.

And we thought that we could just coast back on what we call the free return course until we found out that we had to make another <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">adjustment</span>. So we did lose those equipments as far as being able to use them, but they were still in the lunar module.

IRA FLATOW: There were a couple of times in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mission</span> where your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">microphones</span> were on and you didn’t it. And you said some things that you may have later <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">regretted</span>, but probably not anymore.

But there was one interesting comment that you said to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Fred</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Haise</span>. You said, I’m afraid this is going to be the last moon mission for a long time. That didn’t pan out that way, did it?

JIM LOVELL: Oh, no. I said that. Well, first of all, I thought I was on what we called VOX, voice activated or– push to talk. In other words, I thought I’d have to push the button before anything would go outside of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spacecraft</span>.

And so I was just talking to Fred. We were looking at the moon just as we got in there and said that this is– I said, take a good look at the moon, Fred. It’s going to be a long time before anybody gets back here.

IRA FLATOW: Why did you say that?

JIM LOVELL: Because that’s exactly what I thought at the time.

IRA FLATOW: Yeah. Well, I guess it’s–

JIM LOVELL: We had no <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">propulsion</span>. We had no electricity. We had nothing. And I knew that NASA was going to have to do some real great research. And of course, there was still a great chance that we’d never get back alive.

IRA FLATOW: And you were able to, at one point, to turn around and actually see the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">exploded</span> oxygen tank on the side of the service module. And your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reaction</span> must have been <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">incredible</span> about the amount of damage you could see.

JIM LOVELL: Well, just before we hit the Earth’s atmosphere on the way home, we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">jettisoned</span> the service module. We <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">maneuvered</span> slightly so that as it <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tumbled</span> by, hopefully we could take some pictures which– that occurred. We took some pictures and saw the whole side of the spacecraft <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">blown</span> off.

IRA FLATOW: And how long did it take for them to find out what really went wrong?

JIM LOVELL: It took about three months of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intensive</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">investigation</span>. After the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">splashdown</span>, we looked at the history of the spacecraft building. We went back and looked at the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">telemetry</span>. We reproduced in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">laboratories</span> what we thought went wrong.

We had a pretty good idea, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fairly</span> shortly. But we had to reproduce the situation by testing. And then we finally got the answer. Most <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">accidents</span> in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">aircraft</span> are caused by a series of incidents that either <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">overcome</span> the pilot and/or the airplane.

This was a classic example of that situation. The accident was set up five years before we took off, when NASA, at that time, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">informed</span> all the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">contractors</span> to make the electrical equipment in the spacecraft <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">compatible</span> with the high <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">voltage</span>, which I think was about 65 <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">volts</span>, DC <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">voltage</span>, at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Cape</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Kennedy</span>, even though the spacecraft flew with only 28 volt DC power.

And the main reason was they could do some testing a lot quicker at the Cape with the higher <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">voltage</span>. Everybody did, except the fellow who built the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">heater</span> system in the oxygen tank. The heater system had a little <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">thermostat</span> to prevent it from getting too hot, but it was compatible with only the 28-volt power and not the higher voltage that was available at the Cape.

IRA FLATOW: You made mention of later on that when they discovered what a good lifeboat that the LEM could be, that it was changed to be able to be a lifeboat. In what ways was the LEM changed to be more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hospitable</span>? Or [INAUDIBLE] that you know that it was changed?

JIM LOVELL: Well, I don’t think it was changed physically as much as the procedures were <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">incorporated</span> in case that this thing happened again.

IRA FLATOW: I see.

JIM LOVELL: That the lunar module could be used as an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">auxiliary</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">propulsion</span> system or a living space while there is something wrong with the command module.

IRA FLATOW: We’re talking this hour about the dangerous mission of Apollo 13. Jim Lovell, the commander of Apollo 13 and an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">astronaut</span> for many years and author of the book Lost Moon– The <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Perilous</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Voyage</span> of Apollo 13, published by <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Houghton</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Mifflin</span>, which has been made into a film <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">starring</span> Tom Hanks. And we’ll find out. Does Tom Hanks do a good Jim Lovell, Jim?

JIM LOVELL: Oh, yeah. He’s an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">excellent</span> actor.

IRA FLATOW: I didn’t ask that question. I said, does he do a good Jim Lovell?

JIM LOVELL: Well, yeah. He spent four days down with me. And he got the character down pretty <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pat</span>. And he was a closet <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">astronaut</span>. He always wanted to play the part of an astronaut when he got in the acting business. And he finally found the product that he wanted to do.

IRA FLATOW: More of my 1995 interview with the late Apollo 13 commander, Jim Lovell, in just a moment.

JIM LOVELL: It gives me a little bit of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sense</span> of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">satisfaction</span> to be on a flight that had such an interesting beginning, middle, and ending.

IRA FLATOW: Stay with us.

SPEAKER 1: Yeah, that’s just what I’m saying. The time to do it is now. [? Guidance. ?]

SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE]

SPEAKER 1: [? Go, Guidance. ?]

IRA FLATOW: You’re listening to the audio from Apollo 13 mission control in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Houston</span>. It was a little after 10:00 PM on the night of April 13, 1970. Over the hours that followed, the ground controllers and the astronauts on board Apollo 13 would have to come up with a way to deal with the damage from an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">on-board</span> explosion and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">invent</span> a way to get the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crippled</span> spacecraft and its crew back home safely.

SPEAKER 1: All right.

SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE] as well as– why don’t you tell them what page you want in the checklist?

SPEAKER 1: OK.

SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE]. What’s the matter with the data? [INAUDIBLE]

SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE] looks normal. OK.

SPEAKER 2: We got more of a problem. OK, listen. Listen, you guys. We’ve lost fuel cell one and two <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pressure</span>. We lost O2 tank two pressure.

SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE] you want to look at it?

SPEAKER 2: And temperature.

SPEAKER 1: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Houston, we’ve had a problem.</span>

SPEAKER 2: OK. Stand by. They’ve got a problem.

SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]

SPEAKER 2: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Roger</span>. [INAUDIBLE] <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Guidance</span> for EECOM.

SPEAKER 1: Negative, flight. O2 tank two pressure.

SPEAKER 2: I believe the crew reported it.

SPEAKER 1: We got a main [INAUDIBLE]. OK, flight, we’ve got some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">instrumentation</span> failures. Let me add them up.

SPEAKER 2: Roger. OK. Stand by, 13. We’re looking at it.

SPEAKER 1: We may have had an instrumentation problem, flight.

SPEAKER 2: Roger.

SPEAKER 1: OK. Let’s get our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">interpretation</span> lined up here, you guys. [INAUDIBLE] what do you got? Ground, are you copying us? Air to ground.

SPEAKER 2: The <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">voltage</span> is–

SPEAKER 1: O2 tank two.

SPEAKER 2: It’s looking good, [INAUDIBLE].

SPEAKER 1: –pressure. O2 tank one <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fluctuating</span>. Coming down. And we had a pretty large <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bang</span> associated with the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">caution</span> and warning there. And as I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">recall</span>, [? B ?] was the one that had an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">amp</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spike</span> on it once before.

IRA FLATOW: We’re playing <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">excerpts</span> from a 1995 interview with Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell. It was the week of the 25th <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">anniversary</span> of the flight, and sure enough, the movie <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">starring</span> Tom Hanks would come out but a few months later.

SPEAKER 2: Is that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reflected</span> anywhere?

SPEAKER 1: Negative.

SPEAKER 2: Negative. Say again, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Larry</span>?

SPEAKER 1: No signal gate.

SPEAKER 2: No common signal gate.

IRA FLATOW: You and your co-author, Jeffrey Kluger, have captured some of the real drama that was going on, I mean, the real drama of that first night and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">subsequent</span> nights that we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sat</span> through and listened to. And, in particular, when it came time where you and your fellow <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">astronauts</span> had to push a button and it had to be the exact right button, and if you didn’t push that button at that moment, it was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">curtains</span>. The lights were out forever.

JIM LOVELL: Fred and I were in the lunar module. And it would <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ruin</span> our whole day if he <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">jettisoned</span> us by mistake.

IRA FLATOW: And there was one point where one of the astronauts, I guess, the commander, the command module <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">astronaut</span>, had to transfer the data from the command module into the lunar module. And you had to do it by voice.

And first, he had to mentally make calculations, do a little bit of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">arithmetic</span>. And he so <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">distrusted</span> himself in that time of stress that he wasn’t sure what 5 times 3 was. But that must have been– you have to control your fear in that case, so much just to understand what 5 times 3 is, that the pressure must have been <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">enormous</span>. Was there–

JIM LOVELL: It was pretty high, yes.

IRA FLATOW: Is there anything in your training that makes you prepared for that moment?

JIM LOVELL: Well, I think the background of all three of us was a big help to this situation, because all three of us were test pilots. All three of us had been in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stressful</span> situations before in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">airplanes</span> that weren’t behaving the way they should. And so that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">familiarity</span> with the stressful environment I think really helped us.

IRA FLATOW: All right. We have a lot of people who’d like to ask some questions. So let me go to the phones. Mike in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Coralville</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Iowa</span>. Hi, Mike.

MIKE: Hi, Mr. Lovell. It’s a pleasure to talk to you. I’m a very big <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">admirer</span> of yours. My question for you was, was there any one time that you were completely despaired that you would not get back? And <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">consequently</span>, was there a time when you just came to a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">realization</span> that you were going to get back?

JIM LOVELL: To answer your first question, there was never a time when we were completely <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">despaired</span>. There was a time of greatest <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">apprehension</span> was when shortly after the explosion occurred and we saw the oxygen escaping from the spacecraft, and we realized that very shortly the command module would die.

And we didn’t have solutions at that time of how we’re going to survive the entire trip back home. The command module was the only thing that had a heat shield.

MIKE: Oh, yeah.

IRA FLATOW: Let’s go now to Barry in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Philadelphia</span>. Hi, Barry.

BARRY: Hi. Thank you very much. I’d like to know what kind of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">extraterrestrial</span> experiences you <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gentlemen</span> experienced during this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mishap</span> that you had there.

JIM LOVELL: Do you mean anything that’s strange that we saw that we didn’t understand?

BARRY: Yes.

JIM LOVELL: Well, in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vicinity</span> of the moon, we saw a couple dark shadows or <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shafts</span> out in the void <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">someplace</span>, which we couldn’t quite identify at the time. But we think that they were pieces of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">debris</span> that had followed us to the moon after the explosion and were <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">blotting</span> out some of the stars.

But quite <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">frankly</span>, none of us, none of the astronauts that I know of believe in what we call so-called UFOs. We all believe that there’s life in the universe, intelligent life as we know it. But no foreign visitors around the Earth that come from some other galaxy or some other star system.

IRA FLATOW: Why is it that NASA could command such great attention from the public and have thousands of reporters in the ’60s and the ’70s, and now when the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shuttle</span> is up and there are astronauts up, you hardly see a mention of it anywhere? Have we really lost the desire for space? Are we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">jaded</span>? Jim Lovell, what do you think it is?

JIM LOVELL: Well, I think it’s a natural <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tendency</span>. I remember before the explosion occurred on Apollo 13– and that was 25 years ago– none of the networks carried it. The flight, it was on page 78 of the New York Times about two days before the flight. That was the only mention of the flight.

And we’d become <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">complacent</span> with space flight. And it wasn’t until the accident occurred that there was this great interest. It’s like, this is like going to an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">automobile</span> race. Everybody’s waiting for the crash on the first curve.

And we’ve had over 60-some shuttle flights now, and they’ve become very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">routine</span>. And I look at the shuttle as a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">proven</span> vehicle, much like an airplane. And the action occurs inside the payload <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bay</span>, whether we’re putting up a new <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">satellite</span> or doing some new <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">experiments</span> in space.

IRA FLATOW: Let’s go to the phones to Dan in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Norfolk</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Virginia</span>. Hi, Dan.

DAN: Hi. Mr. Lovell, this is an honor. I’d like to know if you could take the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">opportunity</span> to tell us about your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crewmates</span>, Fred <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Haise</span> and the late Jack <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Swigert</span>.

JIM LOVELL: Yes. I couldn’t have picked two better crewmates to weather the accident with me than Jack Swigert and Fred Haise. Of course, as you know, Jack was not the original command module pilot on this flight. Ken <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Mattingly</span> was.

And we were exposed to the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">measles</span> four days before we were to take off. And <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Mattingly</span> being a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bachelor</span>, everybody was sure he was going to come down with them. And so they replaced him with Swigert because Swigert had the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">measles</span>. And he died, unfortunately, in early 1983.

Fred Haise is still actively employed with the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Grumman</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Northrop</span>, or [INAUDIBLE]. I forget exactly who they went with, but that organization. Both– all three are very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">competent</span>. And of course, all three are in the book.

IRA FLATOW: All right. Thanks for calling, Dan.

DAN: Thank you.

IRA FLATOW: Are you the only person who has ever gone to the moon twice and not set foot on it? And is this a great <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">disappointment</span> now as you look back?

JIM LOVELL: Yes, because the Apollo 13 was going to be the peak of my career. I was going to land on the moon. I told everybody, including the press, that this was my last flight. I would go into NASA management or something like that.

And I thought I couldn’t think of a better way of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">capping</span> a career. And then, of course, we didn’t land. And there was– when the explosion first occurred, of course, there was a lot of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">frustration</span> because we lost a fuel cell. The mission rule said that we couldn’t land without all three fuel cells operating.

And then, of course, it was one of survival. We forgot about the frustration. Now I look at it sort of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wistfully</span>, that it was really a sense of a great <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">triumph</span> to take an almost certain <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">catastrophe</span> and then bring this thing home safely with the help of the ground.

And it gives me a little bit of sense of satisfaction to be on a flight that had such an interesting beginning, middle, and ending.

IRA FLATOW: John in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Encinitas</span>, California. Hi, John.

JOHN: Hi, guys. And I’d like to say hi to Jim. It’s really incredible to be able to talk to you on the phone. I’ve been listening to you for about half an hour. And I’ve got to say, you guys were incredibly cool under unbelievable pressure. That’s the one thing I’d like to say. But then I have a technical question on top of that.

IRA FLATOW: Go ahead.

JOHN: You said that the oxygen <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">thermostat</span>, the heater for the oxygen tank, had a 28-volt, I think it was, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">thermostat</span> on it, or it should have been 65 volts. So I assume that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">burnt</span> out at some point. But then what happened? I mean, what was the sequence beyond–

JIM LOVELL: OK. Yes. I didn’t finish my story there. A second incident occurred. The tank was dropped slightly at the factory years before it was to be put into the service module. They retested it. And then about six weeks before takeoff– before six weeks, we had a countdown demonstration test where we completely filled the tank full of oxygen.

And the tank worked perfectly for everything that it would have to do in flight. After the test, the ground crew went in to remove the oxygen. And when they tried to force it out with the gas, which was the normal procedure, the gas was going out instead of the liquid.

So they looked at the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">schematics</span> of it. And they found out that there was a loose tube. And that might have occurred when they dropped the tank. And so they decided to use the heater system to boil it out. First time they’d ever used it for eight hours of any spacecraft.

They turned it on. The heater system worked. The oxygen started to boil out. The temperature started to rise. As it got to about 80 degrees, the little <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">thermostat</span> started to open up to keep the temperature down.

The high <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">voltage</span> [INAUDIBLE] the contact shut. No <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">safety</span> at all. The temperature kept rising. But no one ever caught the fact that the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">heater</span> did not turn off at the proper time. It got up to 1,000 degrees <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Fahrenheit</span> in that tank, damaged all the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wiring</span>, and damaged the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Teflon</span> covering. But no one ever caught it.

IRA FLATOW: This may be a different day and age, but if this news had come out now about something that happened on the shuttle, there would be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tremendous</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">congressional</span> hearings and things like this that would be going on. Now, in those days, I guess they just said, well, there was a chain of mistakes, and life goes on.

JIM LOVELL: Well, this was a very fortunate ending to this thing. So therefore, it’s a lot easier to make corrections and go ahead. If we had died on the way home, well, you might never have known what happened. That <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">thermostat</span> was in all the flights from 8 all the way through 13.

IRA FLATOW: That’s very interesting. For me, if a tank <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rattles</span>, I throw it out. I get a new tank.

JIM LOVELL: Well, we debated about changing tanks. But it just delayed the flight another month. And since the tank worked perfectly for everything that we had to do in flight, and we’d never de-tank it on the way out to the moon, we saw no problem with it.

IRA FLATOW: But that delay and that month was critical in the period of the space race that we’re talking about. I mean, there was a tight schedule. And was there sort of the politics of the time that even a month would be too much to delay?

JIM LOVELL: Well, there wasn’t much of a race anymore, as you recall. We landed on the moon. And Apollo 8 went around it for the very first time. But there was a schedule to keep. But safety was still very, very important.

And they looked at everything positively and said the tank was working fine. And they looked at the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">schematics</span> before we made the decision to go and said, if that little tube is loose, there’s no problem. We don’t need that little tube on the flight. We’ll just turn the heater on and boil the oxygen out, and then we’ll keep going.

But no one ever thought that it went up to 1,000 degrees. We only had a temperature <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gauge</span> outside the [INAUDIBLE] that went to 80, which was a big mistake.

IRA FLATOW: All right, let’s go to Stevie in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Wayland</span>, Mass. Hi, Stevie.

STEVIE: Hi. I was wondering if I could ask Mr. Lovell, what do you think the future holds for the space program?

JIM LOVELL: Well, that is a big question. I think the future holds a space station, probably basically– this is for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">manned</span> flight– a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">consortium</span> between Russia, the European Space Agency, Japan, Canada and the US.

I think we’re finally going to get our act together. It’s too bad that we wasted billions on studies that never came to anything. [INAUDIBLE] I think that we’re going to start doing some robotic research on the planets of Mars again, and perhaps make another landing on <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Venus</span> with the eventual idea of perhaps a manned Mars flight sometime in the next century.

IRA FLATOW: Martin in Boise, Idaho. Hi, Martin.

MARTIN: Hello. It’s an honor to speak to you, Mr. Lovell. One question– I realize that your craft was the best that we could build at the time. But how would it compare by today’s standards? Just how primitive was it by today’s standards?

JIM LOVELL: Well, it is pretty primitive. We had just one type of computer. It was a hard-wired computer. We didn’t have such things as <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">floppy</span> disks or all the modern stuff that computers have. I think the shuttle takes off with five. If they’re not all talking to each other, we don’t go.

And the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">instrumentation</span> was rather <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crude</span> compared to what we have today. The technology today would probably be able to reduce the weight <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">considerably</span>. But as far as the technology was with other stuff in those days, it was highly advanced. That computer was– actually, we called it the fourth astronaut.

IRA FLATOW: All right, Martin.

MARTIN: OK.

IRA FLATOW: Thanks for calling. There are still three– there were supposed to be 20 <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Saturn</span> missions, the Saturn V missions. Apollo missions. And they cut them back to 17. And there are three Saturn rockets lying around various places around the country. One’s at the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Cape</span>. One is what– in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Huntsville</span>?

JIM LOVELL: Yes.

IRA FLATOW: And where is the third one? I’m trying to remember.

JIM LOVELL: At Johnson Space Center.

IRA FLATOW: Johnson Space– when you drive by that and you look at that, do you get <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pangs</span> when you see that there? It gives me pangs saying I wish this were standing straight and going someplace.

JIM LOVELL: Well, I think one of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tragedies</span> of our decisions in NASA was not to keep the line of the Saturn V running a little bit longer. And I tell you why. We spent all that money for research and development. It’s a beautiful rocket. It puts more into low Earth orbit than the shuttle does.

And when the Challenger accident occurred, we had no backup. And we could have had a fairly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">inexpensive</span> backup if we kept those Saturn Vs on the line.

IRA FLATOW: Jim, is there one memory you take away from this more than any other part of the flight, one thing that stays in your mind?

JIM LOVELL: Well, I’ll never forget the sight of the moon as we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">whipped</span> around it for the very last time, my second flight up there, knowing that I’d never get a third flight. And finally, seeing that little <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">triangular</span> mountain that I named on Apollo 8, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Mount</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Marilyn</span>. And it started to disappear in the background. And it was sort of a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nostalgic</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wistful</span> feeling.

At that time, I think we had a fairly decent idea that we might be able to make through this thing OK.

IRA FLATOW: Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell died last week at the age of 97. This episode was produced by <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Charles</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Bergquist</span>. I’m Ira Flatow. Thanks for listening.
