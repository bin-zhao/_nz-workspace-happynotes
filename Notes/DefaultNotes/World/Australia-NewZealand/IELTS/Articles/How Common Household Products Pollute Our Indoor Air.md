OK, let’s get on with it.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Today on the show–

[HISSING]

–what are you breathing in when you do your hair?

NUSRAT JUNG: When we think about air <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pollution</span>, we think of smoke, we think of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">smog</span>, we think of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wildfires</span>. But we don’t think of everyday <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">haircare</span> products to be causing indoor air pollution.

FLORA LICHTMAN: You’ve probably given some thought to outdoor air pollution. Whether it’s smog from traffic or wildfire smoke, I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">suspect</span> that many of us are checking <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">AQI</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">measurements</span> on our phone more than we used to. But what about the air inside your house? Today we’re talking to a researcher who thinks a lot about indoor air pollution and how we create <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">toxic</span> air without even knowing it and how to avoid it.

Dr. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Nusrat</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Jung</span> is a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">civil</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">environmental</span> engineer at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Purdue</span> University in West <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Lafayette</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Indiana</span>, and she has a new study out on the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">toxins</span> released during basic hair care. Nusrat, welcome to Science Friday.

NUSRAT JUNG: Thank you, Flora. How are you?

FLORA LICHTMAN: I’m well. Let’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">brush</span> up on your recent findings. This is where haircare products meet heat. What did you find?

NUSRAT JUNG: Our study shows that routine hair-based styling can release billions of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nanoparticles</span> into the air just within 10-to-20-minute routine. These particles are small enough to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">penetrate</span> deep into the lungs. So when we think about air pollution, we think of smoke, we think of smog, we think of wildfires. But we don’t think of everyday haircare products to be causing indoor air pollution.

FLORA LICHTMAN: When you talk about basic haircare routines, what do you mean? Is it hair <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spray</span>? Is it using a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">blow dryer</span>? What are we talking about here?

NUSRAT JUNG: Right. So haircare <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">routine</span> means <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">utilizing</span> haircare products that are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">categorized</span> as leave-on haircare products, which means you do not <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wash</span> them off. So we are not talking about <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shampoo</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">conditioner</span>, because that is something you would use when you are taking a shower. We are talking about <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gels</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">creams</span>, hair sprays, oils, any kind of liquids that you would leave on your hair.

FLORA LICHTMAN: And are they releasing these <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nanoparticles</span> only when they’re heated? Or if you’re spraying <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hairspray</span>, you know, if you’re doing <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Aqua</span> Net all over your hair, are you also getting that same dose of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nanoparticles</span>?

NUSRAT JUNG: So we found that heat tends to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">exacerbate</span> the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sheer</span> number of nanoparticles released from everyday <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">haircare</span> products, and this is far greater than what we have ever expected to see.

FLORA LICHTMAN: When you say far greater, what do you mean?

NUSRAT JUNG: The <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">concentrations</span> are about 10,000, 200,000 nanoparticles per <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cubic</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">centimeter</span>. So it is not just about concentration, Flora. This is important to understand because we studied not just the concentration, but what are you going to receive in terms of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dose</span> when you <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">inhale</span>.

So our study shows that the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">exposures</span> can <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rival</span> highway <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">traffic</span>, which means that highway traffic exposure occurs outdoors, where <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pollutants</span> are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">diluted</span> in much larger air volume. In contrast, the hair styling takes place just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">inches</span> away from the nose and mouth in an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">enclosed</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">indoor</span> space where nanoparticle concentrations can build up quickly. But especially this closed <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">proximity</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">confinement</span> gives <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">airborne</span> nanoparticles a more direct <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pathway</span> into the lungs, and the doses can be surprisingly high, even during a short styling routine.

The heat-based hair styling can release billions of nanoparticles into the air within just 10 to 20 minutes, and they <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">deposit</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">penetrate</span> deep into the lungs. And the exposure from a single session can <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rival</span> those from sitting in heavy traffic.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Wow. And you’re doing it every day.

NUSRAT JUNG: Yes.

FLORA LICHTMAN: So do you know what nanoparticles are being generated by these processes? And do if they’re <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">harmful</span>?

NUSRAT JUNG: Yes. So our research shows that some of the tiny particles released during heat styling come from the chemical <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ingredients</span>, particularly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">siloxanes</span>. Siloxanes have been found to lead to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">adverse</span> effects on the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">respiratory</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tract</span>, liver, and nervous system of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">laboratory</span> animals. And when these ingredients are heated, they can break down and form airborne nanoparticles that people breathe in.

So these are really the reactions or the secondary <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mechanism</span> that occurs where they are being formed because they’re exposed to heat.

FLORA LICHTMAN: It’s a chemical reaction, basically.

NUSRAT JUNG: Yes. They become something else than what is listed on the list of ingredients. So I think this is quite serious, because breathing them in can <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">irritate</span> the lungs and worsen conditions like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">asthma</span>. Over time, you have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">potential</span> for more serious impacts because they can pass from lungs into the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bloodstream</span>, they can spread to other organs. And long-term exposure to these kind of particles with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">chronic</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">respiratory</span> and heart disease, and they have possible effects on the brain. So these are serious things.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Are these products regulated for their <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">aerosol</span> effects and these chemicals that they can generate?

NUSRAT JUNG: So our study is the first to have actually discovered what is happening during the process of application of a haircare product. So we can only regulate something if we understand that there is a problem. So none of these products are tested for their emissions, for what happens to them when they are being used. They are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">formulated</span> only to do certain things. But no, we have never seen that information on any packaged material. I have never come across it.

FLORA LICHTMAN: As I was reading about this, it occurred to me that there’s just tons of things that we <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spray</span> on a daily basis. There are things that we heat up on a daily basis, our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cookware</span>. What is your top concern for indoor air pollutants? Or what are you most interested in studying?

NUSRAT JUNG: So I have been fascinated, Flora, with our everyday life and what can we be exposed to. So our discoveries have come from basically observing and then really using <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cutting-edge</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">instrumentation</span> to measure these everyday activities, to understand what is not visible to us.

So air pollution in indoor environments is very, very important because we spend more than 90% of our time indoors. I mean, if you want to think about it, we all go to sleep in a building. We wake up, we leave our building to go to some other building that may be work or may be coffee shop. Then we go to lunch, we are in another building. Then we go back home, and that is another building. Maybe we go to a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gym</span> later in the evening. That’s another building.

So as humans, we keep rotating from one building to another. We spend 90% of our time inside buildings. And what happens within these buildings is really important to capture in terms of emissions. Cooking activities are sources of air pollution. Using <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">scented</span> products, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">candles</span> are sources of air pollution. Using heavily centered cleaning products in your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">enclosed</span> home environment is a source of air pollution.

So we are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">inadvertently</span> causing all of these chemical reactions in these. Really, we live in boxes that are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mechanically</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ventilated</span>. And if the ventilation conditions are good, even then you are not able to remove all of these pollutants. For example, the pollutants we are talking about today are coming from haircare products. The <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sheer</span> number of nanoparticles are so many that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ventilation</span> alone is not able to get rid of it.

So honestly, that’s a lot about problems in internal environments. I think I’d like to make it a little lighter and maybe think about solutions.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Well, yeah, I was going to ask. I mean, what are the solutions, do you think?

NUSRAT JUNG: So my number one recommendation is, if there is any way you can get rid of your chemical <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mixtures</span> that you are introducing next to your nose and your mouth would be like the best thing you can do. The second best thing you can do is simply reduce the frequency of them. Try to limit it to once in a week, once in three days. Third would be limit the use of the amount of the product you are applying. Fourth would be to, yes, have ventilation on. I mean, ventilation does help.

But then we have other problems, like what you are exhausting from your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bathroom</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">exhaust</span>, maybe someone else’s air <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intake</span> in a city like New York. So these nanoparticles, these <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">volatile</span> chemical mixtures, they are cycling through our buildings. So honestly, the best way would be to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ideally</span> remove the source of them.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Has your own hair routine changed since you started studying this?

NUSRAT JUNG: Yes. So I am <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">blessed</span> with quite many <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">curly</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wavy</span> hair, and I have enjoyed being in these <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">aisles</span> and aisles of so many kinds of haircare products. And believe me when I say I have used so many of them. And then our team started measuring what is being released, and I think it was one surprise after another surprise. And that surprise turned into a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shock</span>. And then that shock resulted in simply coming back home and getting rid of every single bottle of spray, cream, heat <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">protectant</span> that I had.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Really?

NUSRAT JUNG: Yes. I have decided now to be totally natural. So I’m very, very pleased with having changed my haircare routine and simply removed all chemical mixtures from my everyday routine.

FLORA LICHTMAN: That says a lot, I think.

NUSRAT JUNG: Yeah, because if you think about it, Flora, your body is not filtering these things out. When people choose to smoke, it’s like it’s their choice, right? It’s like, OK, I am smoking because I want to smoke, and you kind of have your own will. But in case of a haircare routine, I mean, I never thought that I’m being exposed to anything at all.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Yes. I think that’s the fascinating thing about this, that it is a window into how little we really probably know about these kind of exposures, that we didn’t even think to wonder about this kind of exposure.

NUSRAT JUNG: Yeah. Heat-based <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hairstyling</span> should be recognized as an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">emerging</span> and serious public health <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">concern</span>. And these exposures occur right where people live, where they breathe, they spend most of their time, and yet they remain invisible and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">unregulated</span>. We have worked on indoor smoking <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bans</span>, and we have now come up with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">volatile</span> organic <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">compound</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">VOC</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">labeling</span> for our building materials. This <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">represents</span> another <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">blind</span> spot that deserves attention.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Thank you for taking the time to talk to us.

NUSRAT JUNG: Thank you, Flora.
