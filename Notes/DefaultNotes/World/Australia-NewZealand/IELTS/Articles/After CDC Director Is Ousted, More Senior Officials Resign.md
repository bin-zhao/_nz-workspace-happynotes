FLORA LICHTMAN: Hey, I’m Flora Lichtman, and you’re listening to Science Friday. Before we get going, we are kicking off one of our favorite “<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cephalobrations</span>” of the year. You got it, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Cephalopod</span> Week. And you can get in on the party by <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sponsoring</span> virtual cephalopods. When you donate $8 or more– that is a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tentacle</span> shout-out– you’ll have the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">opportunity</span> to choose from eight beautifully <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">illustrated</span> sea creatures, which we’ll post on our Sea of Support web page along with your first name.

We’re aiming to raise $8,000 here, which will support all the work we do at SciFri. As you know, this has been a challenging time for public media, so if you want to show your support for SciFri, I hope you will “<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">consquider</span>” making a gift. Head to sciencefriday.com/sea-of-support, that’s sciencefriday.com/sea-of-support, to help us reach our goal. And thank you.

Today on the show, checking in on the CDC.

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: When you see that folks aren’t listening to scientists, not listening to experts, but are rather trying to make decisions without science, that’s when harm begins.

FLORA LICHTMAN: We’re checking in on the Centers for Disease Control and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Prevention</span>. Last week, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Secretary Kennedy</span> and the White House fired the CDC director after only a month in the job. Right after, several other <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">senior</span> leaders resigned from the agency, including Dr. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Demetre Daskalakis</span>, an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">infectious disease physician</span> and former director of the National Center for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Immunization</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Respiratory</span> Diseases at the CDC.

Demetre, welcome to Science Friday.

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: Thank you so much for having me.

FLORA LICHTMAN: OK, so you spent five years at CDC. You led the COVID vaccine task force. You became the head of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">immunizations</span>. You were a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">civil</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">servant</span> for most of your career. You <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">resigned</span> a week ago. Was it a difficult decision?

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: Yeah, I mean, I think that the actual action of resigning was one of the hardest decisions I’ve made in my life. I’ll say, however, my <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">justification</span> for resigning, that wasn’t <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ambiguous</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Tell us a little more.

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: Yeah, I mean, I worked in local public health during probably one of the most <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">consequential</span> moments in public health history, was in New York City during the beginning of COVID-19 in January 2020, where I was the incident <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">commander</span>. That meant being in charge of the public health response for the Department of Health and Mental <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Hygiene</span>. I’ve run responses for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Legionella</span>, which is so complicated; for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">measles</span>. And I’ve worked with folks who are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">politically</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">appointed</span> or <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">elected</span>.

It’s always one of the most amazing parts of a job of a public health person, to be someone who’s a scientist who’s able to discuss things with folks who are non-scientists, to get them to the place where they understand what you’re saying. And so that tends to mean <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bidirectional</span> interaction. But I was never able to brief Secretary Kennedy. I’ve never met the man. I never knew what was coming.

I hear about <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">directives</span> that have no material to back them up. I hear one thing being said in the media that doesn’t <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">correlate</span> with what the science says, like use <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vitamin</span> A to prevent <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">measles</span> as opposed to vaccine, all that stuff. Eventually, you get to the place where you’re like, I just can’t– I can’t really function. And then when you see that folks aren’t listening to scientists, not working with them to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">meld</span> where science and policy meet, but are rather trying to make decisions without science, that’s when harm begins, and I couldn’t be there anymore.

FLORA LICHTMAN: What is the state of the agency now?

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: I’m going to use exactly the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">terminology</span> that Secretary Kennedy used. I think that CDC is in trouble. He cites the trouble being on the inside, and I cite the trouble being on the outside. So I think that CDC is in trouble because it’s been <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stripped</span> of scientific leadership.

Like, forget me, that was my choice to leave. But with no CDC director for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Lord</span> knows how long, or potentially a CDC director with no scientific background, I think that we’re in a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dire</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">strait</span> as long as we continue to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dehumanize</span> experts, say don’t listen to the experts, and continue to run the agency as if though it’s a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hedge</span> fund or a battery company.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I mean, you were the former head of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">immunizations</span>. In your opinion, can we trust CDC <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">guidance</span> now?

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fear to</span> say that. Unless something changes <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">radically</span>, I would question all of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">recommendations</span> coming out of CDC, especially in vaccine space. Go to your trusted source, which, in my opinion at this point, needs to be your medical provider, your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pediatrician</span>, your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">internist</span>, your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pharmacist</span>, whoever takes care of you or you can access to ask questions because I don’t know what’s going to come out of the agency in this space.

FLORA LICHTMAN: That’s a shocking thing to hear.

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: But I’m not the only one who said it. I mean–

FLORA LICHTMAN: No, I know.

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: –this Is not a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">commentary</span> on the science or the scientists, it’s the commentary on the political leadership that seemingly would prefer to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wrestle</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ideology</span> onto the American people rather than science-based recommendations.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I want to talk about how these changes at the CDC are going to impact and are impacting Americans.

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: Yeah.

FLORA LICHTMAN: In your view, what are the risks or dangers to people listening to this show right now because of these <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bureaucratic</span> changes?

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: Right now, what the risk is, is that if there are people who have no specific <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">expertise</span> in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pediatrics</span>, public health, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">immunization</span>, who are influencing decisions around vaccines, those decisions have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ramifications</span> for how people could access vaccine. Just in the last week, we saw that, based on the regulatory actions at FDA, people aren’t going to be able to get vaccines easily in their <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pharmacies</span> for COVID-19. More of that is coming.

These aren’t pointy-headed policy decisions. If the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Advisory</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Committee</span> on Immunization Practices– it’s the vaccine committee that advises the director of CDC on how to make policy for vaccines– if they say the vaccine should no longer be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">administered</span> to children, and if the CDC director or their <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">equivalent</span> signs off on that, that means that insurance will no longer cover that vaccine. It means that there may be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">implications</span> for the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">manufacturers</span>, in terms of the market, to be able to keep making it. It means that there may be some problems with providers feeling <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">comfortable</span> providing the vaccine, from the perspective of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">liability</span>.

With one <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">swipe</span> of the pen, what would happen is that you would limit access to people. So what this should read to people is not that we are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">potentially</span> increasing freedom by making vaccine recommendations more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">constricted</span>, but in fact, the opposite is happening, where you’re going to limit access so people have no choice. I believe in the science behind vaccines. I am a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">skeptic</span> of vaccines, which is why I ask all the questions that I do in the spaces that I’ve been in. But I really think that if there’s no access, there’s no choice. And that’s really what’s at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stake</span>.

The other part of that, though, as well, is that even if there’s not a problem with access, all of this chaos that’s being created by the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">secretary</span> is going to mean that people won’t know what to do. Doctors won’t what to do; they won’t where to look for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">guidance</span>. Patients will be confused. And, both from the perspective of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">destabilizing</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">confidence</span> in vaccines and destabilizing <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">access</span>, for people on the ground, that means more diseases that could be prevented; more times where a kid is going to end up in the hospital instead of spending time with their parents on a holiday; more opportunities for an older adult to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">admitted</span> to the hospital because of something that could have been prevented.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Where do we go from here? Is it now the job of local governments of states to step in?

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: So I think they have no choice. The states are going to have to step up. And I think we’ve seen a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">coalition</span> of states on the West Coast and a coalition of states in the Northeast already forming because they’re starting to not have trust in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">federal</span> public health to be able to execute on what they think is important for public health.

FLORA LICHTMAN: These are states who are getting together and saying, OK, we’re going to come up with our own immunization <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">guidelines</span> and we’ll protect vaccine access in our states.

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: And even like, and we’re going to figure out how to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">purchase</span> our own vaccine separately. They’re doing all of these things. And what that is going to do is, for the states that have elected to do that, great. The states that are resourced to be able to do their own thing, great. But there are going to be states that are not <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">resourced</span> in the same way, that may not have the political will to join in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">alliances</span>.

And that’s going to mean have and have-not in the United States from the perspective of equity. And by <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">equity</span>, I don’t mean <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">buzzword</span>; I mean equity with a capital E, which is what all public health is. And that means making sure that people are able to achieve their maximum health despite where they live in society.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Well, you’re also seeing states, on the other hand, like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Florida</span>, who said this week that they are going to work to eliminate all vaccine <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mandates</span>.

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: Yeah.

FLORA LICHTMAN: And the argument is that the government should not tell you what you have to put in your body. What do you make of that?

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: Yeah, really important to say that states make their own decisions. Also important to say that a sort of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">announcement</span> from a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">podium</span> does not then mean <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">implementation</span> is happening tomorrow. I think that there’s a lot of steps to get that recommendation over the finish line, or that plan over the finish line. So this is an example of a policy that, no matter how you cut it, is going to potentially mean that fewer people are vaccinated. And that’s going to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">manifest</span> itself as more disease.

It’s up to Florida. Like, being a federal government person, you can’t really tell people what to do in the state. So this is their decision. It’s not the decision I would recommend, and it is also a decision that will <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">undoubtedly</span> result in vaccine-<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">preventable</span> diseases. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Measles</span> may become an everyday part of life in Florida; <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">polio</span> may as well. And so this policy decision will likely mean fewer people will be vaccinated, especially kids, and that opens them up to vaccine-preventable diseases that could lead to illness at best, disability, death at worst.

FLORA LICHTMAN: This is a big question, and I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">apologize</span> in advance. But there was a shooting at CDC last month. I understand that the bullets went through your window. You weren’t there, fortunately.

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: Yep.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Demetre, how did we get to a place where science and scientists are quite literally under attack?

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: I think that the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dehumanization</span> of scientists that’s occurring in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rhetoric</span> that’s coming from leadership in science in the US, that’s gone into this sort of mass <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">consciousness</span> of America. And the people that I work with at CDC, they live and breathe just to make sure that the health of the people they serve is protected. That’s all they do.

Public health folks that do applied public health, they’re the ones that make sure that there’s vaccines in your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pharmacy</span>, vaccines in your doctor’s office. They’re the ones that make sure that there’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Narcan</span> available in your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">jurisdiction</span> so you can not have people dying of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">overdose</span>. It’s the things, the invisible things that you never know are happening unless you need them. And that’s the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">thrill</span> that everyone gets in working in public health. So <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vilifying</span> and dehumanizing the people means that you don’t realize that people just like you next door are doing the work to keep you healthy.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Do you see a path out? Do you see a way to restore trust in science?

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: I think that this is where a leader steps up and says, mistakes have been made, there are things that we need to improve, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">let’s do this by building and not destroying</span>. The opportunity for leadership is to stop the rhetoric and focus on the science and redirect this back to what it’s supposed to be, which is to protect the health of American people, rather than be a tool to please a base.

FLORA LICHTMAN: And <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">presumably</span> there are things to fix and change, right?

DEMETRE DASKALAKIS: 100%. Everybody agrees. Oh my <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gosh</span>, everybody in public health wants to make it better. You can’t do it for free. You can’t make it better for free and cut 2,000 staff, right? You can’t <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">slash</span> and burn and then expect for it to function. There needs to be more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rationality</span>, and there needs to be a plan.

> TODO

And so, where’s the plan– That’s a great question for HHS, like, where is your big plan? Other than gold standard science rhetoric, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">radical transparency rhetoric</span>. It’s a lot of words and no plan.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Dr. Demetre Daskalakis is the former director of the National Center for Immunization and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Respiratory</span> Diseases at the CDC.
