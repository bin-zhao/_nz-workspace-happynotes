FLORA LICHTMAN: Hey, I’m Flora Lichtman, and you’re listening to Science Friday.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Today on the show, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">archaeologists</span> are turning their attention to an art form that’s been largely <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">overlooked</span>– <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tattoos</span>.

DANNY RIDAY: To modify is human. And it has been since the beginning.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Last month, researchers used near-<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">infrared</span> photography to get a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">brand</span> new, detailed look at human art from thousands of years ago, a beautiful scene of wild animals kind of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tussled</span> in a fight. But these weren’t paintings on a cave wall or a rock somewhere. They were tattoos on the arm of an ancient <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Siberian</span> woman who lived 2,300 years ago.

Ancient tattoos may seem like an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">unconventional</span> academic focus, which is why I love the story so much. So what can ancient <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ink</span> tell us about our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ancestors</span>? A lot, according to my next guests. Here to stick and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">poke</span> our way into this topic are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Aaron</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Deter</span>-Wolf, archaeologist for the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Tennessee</span> Division of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Archaeology</span> based in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Nashville</span>, and his research <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">collaborator</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Danny</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Riday</span>, a practicing tattoo artist based in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Les</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Eyzies</span>, France. Welcome to you both to Science Friday.

AARON DETER-WOLF: Thank you so much, Flora. It’s great to be here.

DANNY RIDAY: Yeah, absolutely. It’s a pleasure.

FLORA LICHTMAN: OK, Aaron, let’s start with you. Let’s start with this new study on this ancient Siberian <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mummy</span>. First of all, what did her tattoos look like? Can you describe them?

AARON DETER-WOLF: So this woman had a series of tattoos on both of her arms. Both of her <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">forearms</span> were tattooed with scenes of animals that, as you said, are tussling or <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">engaged</span> in fighting or battle. And then both of her hands also then have series of tattoos on them, on the thumbs and across her first <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">knuckles</span> of her fingers.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I mean, I’m looking at it. It’s so beautiful. First of all, I feel like anyone listening really should check it out. We’re going to put it on our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Instagram</span>, @SciFri, so you can see it. And it looks like three– I don’t know– tigers– would you say that?– going after a elk? How would you describe it?

AARON DETER-WOLF: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Elk</span>, deer, horse, deer. There’s this whole style of art has been called <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Scythian</span> animal style. And one of the fun things about this has been that Danny, who has been <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">collaborating</span> with me for years on projects related to ancient tattooing, one of his practices is working in Scythian animal-style art. He does a lot of work there. And so his knowledge and view of these pieces was really just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">incredible</span> and I think really important to the process.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Well, Danny, you’re a tattoo artist, and I know you’ve been <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">collaborating</span> with Aaron on this research for years. Do we know how they were made?

DANNY RIDAY: So our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">assessment</span> that they were made via the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hand-poked</span> tattooing technique. That is holding a sharp <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">utensil</span> made of one end or more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">needle</span> points between the first few fingers and poking by a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">repetitive</span> series of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pricks</span> the tattooing implement <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dipped</span> into <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pigment</span> and then pricked into the skin.

AARON DETER-WOLF: And one of the cool things that Danny was able to identify by looking at these images is the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">presence</span> of more than one tool, is that there are differences in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">thicknesses</span> of lines. That shows us that they were not just using a single tool, but they had at least probably a single point tool for very fine line work, and then a bigger tool that was made out of a cluster of needles that was used then for larger lines.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Like a tattoo kit.

AARON DETER-WOLF: Exactly like a tattoo kit. Yeah, people in the past, they used different tools to create different designs. The people that were doing this tattooing especially, they were not just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">one-offs</span>. This was a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">generational</span> practice. These people were <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">craftspeople</span>. And they had <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">undoubtedly</span> learned this through these long-term <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">transmissions</span> of knowledge going through generations.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Like any artist, probably.

AARON DETER-WOLF: Like any artist. Absolutely.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Yeah. Aaron, how many academics focus on ancient tattoos?

AARON DETER-WOLF: Oh, I think there’s at least seven of us.

FLORA LICHTMAN: [LAUGHS] How did you get into this, and why?

AARON DETER-WOLF: So I got my first tattoos when I was in graduate school. I went to graduate school to study <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Maya</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">archaeology</span>. And when studying the ancient Maya, one of the things that we’ve known about them for years is that they decorated and modified their bodies. They tattooed. They <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">scarified</span> their faces. They did all kinds of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">amazing</span> things.

So working at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">archaeological</span> sites in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Guatemala</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Belize</span>, we would find <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">obsidian</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">blades</span> that we could <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intuit</span> and understand were used for body modification, were used for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bloodletting</span> or tattooing. But in my research and in my work as an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">archaeologist</span> in North America, I had never encountered a tool that I could <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">confidently</span> say was used for tattooing. And as I began to look into this a little more, I realized that this was actually the case all over the world.

We know that ancient <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Egyptians</span> tattooed, but we have no idea what tool they used. We know that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Ötzi</span> the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Iceman</span> tattooed in the European <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Copper</span> Age, but we had no idea what tool was used to do that. And so, as an archaeologist, this really bothered me because what we’re supposed to be doing out there is understanding culture of the past. And if we can’t find these tools that are so important and are part of such an important process, it would be like not being able to find people’s houses, rgiht? How could we talk about the past if we couldn’t find people’s houses?

And so I wanted to understand why we weren’t finding these things and see if I could come up with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">convincing</span> ways to identify them. There have been tattoo tools identified in the past in archaeological collections, but it’s kind of been, oh, these look sharp, and maybe they were using them to tattoo. And mostly those <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">identifications</span> are made by people who weren’t familiar with the practice and didn’t have tattoos themselves.

And I think that’s been a big part of this process, has been that working with Danny and working with other people who are tattooed and understand tattooing, that’s a sea change from the analysis that’s been done over the past century of tattoo tools and tattooed <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mummies</span> because most of the people doing that work weren’t themselves tattooed. They might have seen tattoos, but they hadn’t gone through the experience, and they didn’t understand how these things actually worked at a physical level. And so I think that’s been a huge difference in what we’re able to bring to the table.

FLORA LICHTMAN: It’s like an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">oversight</span>, basically.

AARON DETER-WOLF: Yeah, it would be like trying to write about cooking without ever having eaten with a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spoon</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: [LAUGHS] Danny, you’re a tattoo artist. Why do you care about the research side of this?

DANNY RIDAY: So I was trained as a traditional machine tattoo artist many years ago. And as I progressed as a professional tattoo artist, I kept finding that the older something was, the more interesting it was. A lot of my questions ended up leading towards how many traditional cultures were creating such <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intricate</span> and outstanding works of art with such simple, traditional tools.

And it led me to completely <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">abandon</span> tattooing machines and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pursue</span> testing certain other implements on myself, like sharp rocks, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cactus</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">thorns</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lemon</span> tree <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">thorns</span>, and things like that. And as my questions about ancient tattooing gathered and mounted, I started trying to reach out towards people I thought might have the answers, and Aaron is at the top of that list.

AARON DETER-WOLF: Yeah. We met on Instagram of all <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">silliness</span>. And so yeah, we started talking. Oh, the iceman, isn’t it cool? He’s got 61 tattoos. How were they done? We have no idea. How were tattoos made in the ancient <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Andes</span>? Yeah, we have no idea. And so we went from that to these questions of, well, how can we figure that out? And I think we’ve been able to make some really cool discoveries about how tattooing was done in the past and then, yeah, then learn about what that means for individuals.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I mean, I know that you both worked on a very famous iceman, Ötzi. He was extremely well <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">preserved</span>, over 5,000 years old. What did his tattoos look like?

AARON DETER-WOLF: So his are very different. So Ötzi’s tattoos consist of 61 separate marks that are just series of either short <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">parallel</span> lines or a couple of crossed lines that are on various places on his body. There’s some on his wrist, a lot on his lower legs, below the knees, the front of his stomach and chest area.

And one of the things that’s really interesting about Ötzi is we don’t understand them from an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">iconographic</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">perspective</span>. We don’t know what they’re trying to show us. We see them just as short lines. And I think because of that, it’s been widely assumed that his tattoos don’t mean anything, and that instead, they’re more likely to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">therapeutic</span> treatments of some kind than to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">convey</span> a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">idea</span> or a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">symbol</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: That’s kind of a funny <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">assumption</span> because many people have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">geometric</span> tattoos today, and obviously, they mean something to them.

AARON DETER-WOLF: Absolutely. No, I think that is a huge error that’s happened to this point.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Danny, I understand you did some of this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">experimentation</span> on yourself to figure out how these ancient tattoos were actually made. Is that right?

DANNY RIDAY: Yeah, that’s correct. Aaron and I outlined a project in which we would gain a clear data set of what marks different tattooing implements leave. And I performed that tattoo series on my leg so that we would have a controlled sample.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Like what kind of implements?

DANNY RIDAY: So the different tools were– let’s see if we can remember them all– hand poking with an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">obsidian</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spike</span>, tattooing with a single-point bone tool made of deer bone, tattooing with a single-point copper tool– because Ötzi the Iceman also had copper tools, we wanted to include a single-point copper tool– and also what we would call <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">incision</span> tattooing, making a series of small cuts and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rubbing</span> ink into it. And then the other two tattoos were performed by my friend and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">colleague</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Mokonui-a-rangi</span> Smith, who is a traditional <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Maori</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tattooer</span> who has done the two-hand tapping tattoos, one with a multiple-point tool and one with a single-point tool.

FLORA LICHTMAN: As a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">layperson</span> here, this sounds pretty <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hardcore</span>, Danny. Which hurt the least? Was it painful?

DANNY RIDAY: Well, it’s an interesting question because we imagine these kinds of tattooing techniques as being very painful. If you observe hand <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tapping</span> tattoos in progress that we would see across <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Polynesia</span>, the outside observer really imagines something <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">atrociously</span> painful, when in fact, it’s quite the opposite. I find that hand tapping tattoos are the most relaxing to receive. Hand poking as well is quite un-severe, really. So pain is not really a factor when we consider the world of traditional tattooing.

I will say that the one that took the longest was the one that our colleague, Maya <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Jacobsen</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">coached</span> me through, which was a traditional technique of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Arctic</span> Circle and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Inuit</span> peoples, where an eye needle is passed through the skin in what we would call <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">subdermal</span> or skin stitch tattooing. It was an extremely difficult tattoo to perform. And the results give us a really clear idea of what that looks like, and now we can compare that many of our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mummified</span> human remains that we look at.

AARON DETER-WOLF: A lot of people when we talk about these things, that one of the first questions is, are you tattooed? And obviously, Danny is heavily tattooed. For me, I have become <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">steadily</span> more tattooed since engaging in this research. It turns out, when you hang out with tattoo artists, that you’re going to end up getting tattoos.

And I do have lines on my wrist that were hand-poked with a deer bone. Danny did incision tattooing below that, across my wrist, as a way for me to experience what that was like, and also as, again, another measure for what we can compare to preserved skin in the archaeological record and how we can help to see how those ancient tattoos were made.

FLORA LICHTMAN: After the break, what do these ancient tattoos tell us about why we tattoo ourselves today?

DANNY RIDAY: It’s a reflection of our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">innate</span> desire to modify not only our surroundings, not only our clothing, not only our tools, our weapons, our homes, but also our bodies.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

FLORA LICHTMAN: Do you see tattoos as a window into culture? What can they tell us? What can they teach us?

AARON DETER-WOLF: Oh, they can teach us all kinds of things. If you think about this as an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">iceberg</span>, the tattoo is really just the thing that sticks up above the water. But <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">underneath</span> the water is this whole bigger, entangled <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mess</span> of culture that results in someone being tattooed. And so what we’re really trying to do here is basically to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dive</span> down, to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">claw</span> our way under what the tattoo itself is on the skin, and try to use that into a window to see individual parts of the past.

What was the experience of this individual person? How did they get this thing done? And then from there, branching out into questions like, well, who made it? Why is that significant? What can we say about the artists or about the people who made and use these tools? And can we identify them in the archaeological record? But I think there’s no limit to what we can learn about people individually and their culture <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">writ-large</span> from tattooing.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I want to go back to the Siberian woman for a moment. So when I look at this tattoo, it is hardcore. It’s beautiful, and it is also kind of hardcore. I know the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Scythians</span> were <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">warriors</span>. And they ride on horseback. Does this tattoo and seeing it in all its <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">glory</span> change or fill out our picture of these people or the role of women in this society?

DANNY RIDAY: So for the greater Scythian culture, women held a place of greater importance than they did in their neighboring cultures of ancient <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Greece</span>, ancient <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Persia</span>, and ancient China. The Scythians were more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">egalitarian</span> in their cultural status. Women could become warriors or own property or own <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">slaves</span>.

But of course, this was something that would have taken a couple different sessions to perform. Obviously, the left arm was maybe one session of several hours. The right arm is at least two different sessions of several hours each. The image on her right arm especially is quite <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sensational</span>.

None of this was done off the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cuff</span>. These were really carefully chosen, carefully selected, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">masterfully</span> tattooed images that this person, obviously, chose to have in a very visual part of their body. The <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">forearm</span> was something that they would be able to show to others, which I think is a pretty significant part as well.

AARON DETER-WOLF: Our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">co-author</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Gino</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Caspari</span>, who was the– he was the first author on this paper, some of the things he’s pointed out is that there are only seven examples of preserved skin from ancient Scythian cultures, and all of them are tattooed. So we have a very small sample, but 100% of the sample have tattoos. The other thing he’s pointed out that I think is really interesting is that none of the tattoos are the same. They share artistic style and themes, but they are not identical from person to person, even within the same tombs, even within the same site.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Wow.

AARON DETER-WOLF: And so that suggests that there may be a level of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">agency</span> here that is separate from people just being <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">awarded</span> things for certain cultural reasons, that there might be some freedom of choice of the tattooer or the artist as to who gets what and why.

FLORA LICHTMAN: OK. In studying this across cultures, over time, what has this told you about why we tattoo ourselves at all? What do these ancient tattoos tell us about this modern practice?

DANNY RIDAY: I think what they give us an example of is really that to modify is human, and it has been since the beginning. It’s a reflection of our innate desire to modify not only our surroundings, not only our clothing, not only our tools, our weapons, our homes, but also our bodies. There are some body modifications that are so normalized that we don’t even consider them, like cutting our hair, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">trimming</span> our fingernails, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">piercing</span> our ears.

These are what normal humans look like to us. And I think that tattooing, we culturally might see it as something extreme in Western society now. But given the stretch of time that it has likely been a part of our everyday life as a species, it’s just us.

AARON DETER-WOLF: And one of the things that I’ve discovered in my research is that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">empires</span> don’t tend to like tattooing. Cultures that are trying to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">conquer</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">homogenize</span> other groups, some of the first things that they will <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">eliminate</span> in conquered societies are things like spoken language and body decoration and tattooing. And so the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">colonial</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">era</span> particularly was just really <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">terrible</span> for historical and Indigenous traditions around the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">globe</span>. And there are a lot of people now working to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">recapture</span> those traditions.

And I think that’s really important, too. We’re doing this work <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">archeologically</span>, but there are people who have tattooing traditions in their own <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">heritage</span>, unique Indigenous traditions who are working hard, sometimes <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">alongside</span> us and sometimes in parallel to us, to reconstruct these practices. And their work is really important to this as well.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Thank you both so much for taking the time to talk to me today.

AARON DETER-WOLF: Absolutely. Thank you so much.

DANNY RIDAY: It’s a great pleasure.
