# Birds of paradise have a newly discovered glow

To attract a mate, male _Ptiloris paradiseus_ birds of paradise (one shown) fan their dark wings around their face. They’ll gape — mouth wide open — at a female for 30 seconds or more. Under bluish light, their open mouths glow, really standing out against the birds’ black feathers.

Readability Score: 6.6

Male birds of paradise can really put on a show. They aren’t just adorned with striking colors. They’re also known to use snazzy dance moves to woo potential mates. Now, it seems the flamboyant flyers have one more trick up their wing to heighten the drama of their displays. Under bluish light, many male birds of paradise [have glowing body parts](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.241905).

This type of gleam is called [fluorescence](https://www.snexplores.org/article/scientists-say-fluorescence-definition-pronunciation) (Flor-ESS-ents). It occurs when an object absorbs light at one [wavelength](https://www.snexplores.org/article/scientists-say-wavelength) and then shines light of a lower energy.

Fluorescence “is becoming more and more well-known across the tree of life,” says Rene Martin. She’s a biologist at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Martin has studied fluorescence in deep-sea fishes. Scientists have also found fluorescence in some amphibians and mammals and a handful of birds.

Martin went looking for fluorescent birds while working at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The museum has specimens of all 45 species of birds of paradise. Birds of paradise are found in the forests of Papua New Guinea, eastern Indonesia and eastern Australia.

Martin swept through the collection, shining a blue light flashlight over the birds’ bodies. That color light can prompt some animals to fluoresce. Martin wore yellow goggles that filter out blue light so she could see which birds gleamed green-yellow.

Of the 45 species, 37 fluoresce, her team reported February 12 in _Royal Society Open Science_. The ones that didn’t glow were closely related to each other. These birds of a feather evolved earlier than the fluorescent birds of paradise. The no-glow birds also appear drab to the naked eye and don’t perform fancy dances, Martin says. And unlike their flashier kin, they tend to mate with a single partner.

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">For the birds that do glow, fluorescence seems to help attract a mate</span>, Martin says. Several pieces of evidence point to this.

For one thing, past studies have suggested that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">birds can see fluorescence</span>, based on their eye parts. For another, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">male birds often perform mating dances in areas where they can soak up sunlight containing ultraviolet (UV) or blue wavelengths that kick off fluorescence.</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">The birds’ glowing parts are often on or near parts of their body used in displays.</span> And <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">the fluorescent parts tend to appear against a contrasting background.</span> For example, some male birds fan black wings around their faces. Against the dark feathers, a glowing mouth — gaping wide open at a female — can really pop.

Martin hopes to study live birds to confirm whether males’ fluorescence actually makes them more alluring to females.

Birds of paradise have caught the eye of plenty of scientists in the past, Martin says. But the discovery of their fluorescence is a reminder of how much we still don’t know. “Can you imagine all of the things that we still don’t know about groups of birds or any organism?”

## Way to glow

Rene Martin placed specimens of different birds of paradise under blue light. She photographed them with a camera using a filter that cut the blue light. That allowed <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">the preserved birds’ greenish gleam to show up</span> in pictures. Martin also used a special tool called a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spectrophotometer</span> to measure the wavelengths of light that the birds gave off. **The graphs show these data. The X-axis shows the wavelength of light. The Y-axis shows how bright that light is. Figure A plots the glows of different species. Figure B shows how much different parts of a bronze parotia glow. Figure C shows how much parts of different species glow under a UV light.**

## Data Dive:

1. Think about how birds of paradise use their glowing features. What other animals do you think may fluoresce?
2. Look at [Figure A](https://www.snexplores.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1440_AT-flourescent-birds-graph-A.png). What wavelengths correspond to green-yellow glows in birds of paradise?
3. What are some of the birds’ body parts that glow?
4. Look at [Figure B](https://www.snexplores.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1440_AT-flourescent-birds-graph-B.png). On _Parotia berlepschi_, which part glows the brightest? How does this compare with its black feathers?
5. Look at [Figure C](https://www.snexplores.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1440_AT-flourescent-birds-graph-C.png). How does the brightness of UV excitation light compare with the birds’ glow (the peak at 500 nm)?

**amphibians**: A group of animals that includes frogs, salamanders and caecilians. Amphibians have backbones and can breathe through their skin. Unlike reptiles, birds and mammals, unborn or unhatched amphibians do not develop in a special protective sac called an amniotic sac.

**biologist**: A scientist involved in the study of living things.

**birds**: Warm-blooded dinosaurs with wings that first showed up at least 150 million years ago. Birds are jacketed in feathers and produce young from the eggs they deposit in some sort of nest. Most birds fly, but throughout history there have been the occasional species that don’t.

**filter**: (n.) Something that allows some materials to pass through but not others, based on their size or some other feature. (v.) The process of screening some things out on the basis of traits such as size, density, electric charge. (in physics) A screen, plate or layer of a substance that absorbs light or other radiation or selectively prevents the transmission of some of its components.

**fluoresce**: (adj. fluorescent) The process of absorbing light of one wavelength (color) and reemitting as a different wavelength. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">That reemitted light is known as fluorescence.</span>

**fluorescent**: (v. fluoresce) Adjective for something that is capable of absorbing and reemitting light. That reemitted light is known as fluorescence.

**forest**: An area of land covered mostly with trees and other woody plants.

**kin**: Family or relatives (sometimes even distant ones).

**mammal**: An animal distinguished by possessing hair or fur, the secretion of milk by females for the feeding of their young, and (typically) the bearing of live young. They also are warm-blooded (or endothermic).

**sea**: An ocean (or region that is part of an ocean). Unlike lakes and streams, seawater — or ocean water — is salty.

**society**: An integrated group of people or animals that generally cooperate and support one another for the greater good of them all.

**species**: A group of similar organisms capable of producing offspring that can survive and reproduce.

**tree of life**: A diagram that uses a branched, treelike structure to show how organisms relate to one another. Outer, twiglike, branches represent species alive today. Ancestors of today’s species will lie on thicker limbs, ones closer to the trunk.

**wavelength**: The distance between one peak and the next in a series of waves, or the distance between one trough and the next. It’s also one of the “yardsticks” used to measure radiation. Visible light — which, like all electromagnetic radiation, travels in waves — includes wavelengths between about 380 nanometers (violet) and about 740 nanometers (red). Radiation with wavelengths shorter than visible light includes gamma rays, X-rays and ultraviolet light. Longer-wavelength radiation includes infrared light, microwaves and radio waves.

**woo**: The efforts of a male animal to court a female with the goal of gaining a mate.
