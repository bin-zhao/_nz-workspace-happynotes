# A century later, impacts of the Scopes ‘Monkey Trial’ still echo

The case helped launch a distrust of experts and evolution in much of U.S. society

That humans might have evolved from other members of the primate family (such as apes or other hominids) was highly controversial a century ago. In the United States, it ultimately led to a Tennessee educator being sued for teaching the idea that humans evolved from some earlier primates.

One hundred years ago, a small town in eastern Tennessee captured the attention of the entire country.

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">A biology teacher in Dayton was accused of teaching human evolution to his students.</span> At the time, that was illegal in Tennessee. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">This teacher was put on trial for his crime</span> — an event that quickly became <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">1925</span>’s biggest media event. In fact, it proved one of the most dramatic trials in U.S. history.

![[1fc2129ce35d70db5aec30aff8bdc0de_MD5.jpg]]

From July 10 to July 21, two nationally known, powerhouse lawyers — prosecutor William Jennings Bryan and defense attorney Clarence Darrow — traded sharp verbal barbs in court. What developed turned into far more than a debate over whether one small-town teacher had violated state law. The trial became about religion versus science and old versus new. It also highlighted a personal beef between Bryan and Darrow.

The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes is better remembered today as the Scopes “Monkey Trial.” It ended with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Scopes being found guilty and fined $100.</span>

The jury’s verdict would later be overturned on a technicality. But the trial’s impact did not end here. Its echoes would be felt in science education for decades. It also would lead the way to future court battles — ones that far exceeded the Scopes trial in legal importance (though never in spectacle).

Today, the majority of Americans [accept the theory of evolution as valid](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09636625211035919). Indeed, it has become increasingly essential to understanding the natural world and human origins.

Evolution, generally, also helps explain the rise of new pathogens, such as [the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-covid-19-not-human-made-lab-genetic-analysis-nature) and the emergence of pesticide and [antibiotic resistance](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/antimicrobial-resistance-cause-death-antibiotic-bacteria). These processes of adaptation also make clear how plants and animals accommodate to their ever-changing environments.

To commemorate the centennial of the Scopes trial and its legacy, _Science News_ (our sister publication) asked freelance journalist Darren Incorvaia to speak with Randy Moore. This biologist at the University of Minnesota not only is an expert on the trial, but also authored the 2023 book [_John Thomas Scopes: A Biography_](https://bookshop.org/a/21798/9781440880544).

Their conversation, below, has been edited (with Moore’s permission) for length and clarity.

_**SN**_**: The United States was very different 100 years ago. What was life like back then and how did it set the stage for the Scopes trial?**

**Moore:** The first cars were coming off assembly lines. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Women claimed the right</span> to vote in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">1920</span>. There was new music — <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">jazz</span> — called the devil’s music. People were leaving rural areas and moving to cities.

This great war — <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">World War I</span> — had recently ended, too, shattering many people’s views of all this societal progress. Many people became afraid of change, with a desire to return to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">the good old days</span>.

Against this backdrop, a movement was emerging that would be known as <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">modernism</span>. It harmonized with [Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection](https://www.snexplores.org/article/man-who-rocked-biology-its-core). <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Reason and logic became the source of truth, not literal readings of scripture.</span> Many people abandoned the old ways for this modernism because they felt the old ways were narrow-minded, ill-suited for this new life.

The <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">modernists</span> viewed traditional religion as a reversion to ignorance. But <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">traditionalists</span> countered them, saying “this is how you destroy a country.”

Here’s some original footage from 1925’s so-called Scopes “Monkey Trial.” It pitted fundamentalist Tennesseans against a young teacher who — contrary to law — taught the theory of human evolution. Two of the era’s great courtroom orators, Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan, debated science, religion and Constitutional rights.

_**SN**_**: So there was a big reaction against this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">social change</span> going on.**

**Moore:** There was a rise and popularity of religious celebrities, preachers who tapped into this discontent. Some made opposing evolution their cause. Dwight Moody sort of started it in the 1800s in Chicago. Later, there was Billy Sunday. He would go into towns and attract 5,000 or 10,000 people per service.

Here in Minneapolis, about a mile from my office, was the guy who started to change everything. He was a preacher here at First Baptist Church named William Bell Riley. He realized that to change society, he had to get <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">laws</span> passed.

So he organized <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">the World Christian Fundamentals Association</span> in the late <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">1910s</span>. And it caught on immediately. Riley was a Baptist, but the group was not restricted to Baptists. It had up to 6 million members at its height.

Then, in 1925, Tennessee state representative John Butler <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">introduced a law banning the teaching of human evolution.</span> And it passed.

[Submit your question here](https://forms.gle/YbhPosFTMqjbSNnV7), and we might answer it an upcoming issue of _Science News Explores_

_**SN**_**:** **It didn’t ban** **all evolution, just human evolution?**

**Moore:** Human evolution. That was the sacred cow. It’s fine for skunks to evolve.

Billy Sunday had just been in Memphis. He had preached to almost 10 percent of Tennessee’s population. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Politicians who wanted to be re-elected figured they couldn’t oppose the new law.</span>

_**SN**_**: So fundamentalists opposed human evolution because the idea that we share a common ancestor with other <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">apes</span> and evolved from earlier forms contradicts the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Bible</span>’s story of creation? It’s a concern that anti-evolution groups still hold. But that wasn’t the only thing that led to the trial. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) wanted to challenge the law. And locals hoped a court challenge would bring publicity to Dayton. How did those forces combine?**

**Moore:** Someone at the ACLU saw a little news clipping about Tennessee criminalizing the teaching of human evolution and showed it to the group’s executive director. The ACLU then placed an advertisement in some Tennessee papers seeking someone to challenge the Butler Act.

They got one response. An engineer named George Rappleyea was in Dayton to close a big coal plant. The coal industry had collapsed several years earlier. The city’s population had plummeted. The town was getting poorer. People there needed something to revive the economy.

Rappleyea showed the ad to a group of local businessmen and said, “Why don’t we have a test case here?”

They weren’t activists who care all that much about evolution, specifically. But they realized, look at all this publicity. We can make some money. This could revive Dayton.

_**SN**_**: How did they find their defendant?**

**Moore:** They approached the high school’s full-time biology teacher, William Ferguson, who was also the school principal. And they asked him: “Would you consent to be arrested?” He said no.

Then they came across John Scopes. He’d been the substitute teacher in Ferguson’s biology class for two weeks in April of 1925. A first-year teacher and a football coach, he immediately agreed to take part.

The trial could not have happened without his consent.

_**SN**_**: How did the arrest of a small-town teacher charged with a misdemeanor evolve into a national media circus?**

**Moore:** The next big step involved William Bell Riley. He was the guy in Minneapolis who organized the religious fundamentalists in opposition to evolution. Riley heard about this and said: “This is where we take our stand. Who can we get to represent us? William Jennings Bryan.”

Bryan was a national figure. [He had run for president](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-sound-bites) three times as the Democratic nominee. [He’d also been a former U.S. congressman from Nebraska and U.S. Secretary of State.] He had been condemning evolution. He said, “Yes, I will help prosecute John Scopes.” His joining on behalf of Tennessee was a big deal.

Then the biggest publicity event occurred. Arguably the most famous criminal-defense attorney in the country’s history — Clarence Darrow — volunteered to defend Scopes.

Darrow had campaigned for Bryan [in his presidential races]. But Darrow hated that Bryan had turned to religious fundamentalism. He especially hated his opposition to evolution. Darrow was an agnostic [meaning he wasn’t sure he believed in a god]. So he wanted to expose Bryan’s religious fundamentalism.

Once Darrow entered the contest, people immediately forgot about John Scopes. He was almost irrelevant in his own trial.

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">It became a showdown. Christianity versus atheism. The old versus the new. Bryan versus Darrow.</span>

One day, they started the afternoon proceedings before Scopes even got to the courthouse. It was as if it wasn’t about Scopes.

**_SN_****:** **What was this showdown like? How did the day-to-day of the trial go?**

**Moore:** The prosecution claimed that only John Scopes was on trial. Did he teach human evolution? That’s the only issue. And according to his own students, he did. Two of them got up and testified.

Meanwhile, the defense argued John Scopes is not on trial: The law is. This is about Scopes’ rights.

Darrow brought in experts to testify about the validity of evolution, that evolution was a well-accepted idea. The state’s lawyers objected. And on the second Friday of the trial, the 17th, the judge announced that expert testimony would be excluded. In the end, most science experts never testified.

**_SN_****: What was the media coverage like? Was it as big as those businessmen hoped?**

**Moore:** More than 100 reporters came to Dayton. Anything about the Scopes trial would sell papers. Like what Scopes wore. (He was popular with the ladies.) He was also described as a great football coach.

He was a media darling. Reporters could not care less about evolution. They wanted the name-calling. And there was a lot of that. Reporters said, “My editor can’t get enough.”

The biggest event of the trial happened when the judge ruled that the scientific testimony was irrelevant. The weather had gotten so hot that the proceedings moved outside to this platform. A crowd of several thousand people outside the Rhea County Courthouse now watched the trial.

![[60b7ad9c452849ae9aa7bd5b24464b93_MD5.jpg]]

The Scopes trial was widely attended. On some days as many as 1,000 people (including reporters) packed the “court” (on some days, as here, held outdoors).Hulton Archive/Getty Images

The defense asked, “You would not let us put on experts about science; can we put on an expert about the Bible?” The judge said yes.

And then, in a spectacular move, Darrow called William Jennings Bryan as a witness. Bryan knew he couldn’t refuse.

Darrow grilled him with questions about literal interpretations of the Bible. Was Jonah really swallowed by a big fish? Did the sun stand still? How old is the Earth?

Bryan defended himself relatively well. But the press portrayed him as the loser. _Science News-Letter_, the precursor of _Science News_, reported on “Bryan’s pitiful exhibition of ignorance.”

_**SN**_**: That was a savvy move from Darrow. So in the eyes of the media, Darrow won the showdown with Bryan, even though Scopes lost the trial. What happened after the verdict?**

**Moore:** One of the biggest impacts of the trial was that the word — literally the word, _evolution_ — disappeared from biology textbooks. Pictures of Charles Darwin were gone. It was a horrible loss for teaching evolution. This unifying idea in all of biology was not mentioned.

And religious fundamentalism didn’t go away. It got stronger.

_**SN**_**: Because Scopes’ conviction was overturned, the defense couldn’t appeal the case, right?**

**Moore:** The ACLU looked for another defendant and couldn’t find one. And so the Butler Act stayed on the books for 40-something years. Until the late 1960s.

Two other states had passed similar laws, Arkansas and Mississippi. A teacher challenged Arkansas’ law, and her case went to the U.S. Supreme Court. The court ruled unanimously that banning the teaching of human evolution in public schools is unconstitutional [because it violated the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech].

_**SN**_**: That case was Epperson v. Arkansas in 1968.**

**Moore:** The plaintiff, [Susan Epperson](https://www.sciencenews.org/archive/evolution-reaches-highest-court), was a new biology teacher in Little Rock. She felt she was in an impossible position. If I teach legitimate biology, she worried, I’m knowingly breaking the law. If I follow the law, I’m doing a disservice to my students.

She was asked if she would test the anti-evolution law. After getting the enthusiastic support of her husband, she took on the case. And won.

See Susan Epperson describe how she got recruited to challenge a state law that banned the teaching of evolution in Arkansas’ public schools. In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled that this law — and others like it — were unconstitutional and could no longer be enforced in the United States.

_**SN**_**: But people don’t remember that trial, which was a big win for science and evolution.**

**Moore:** One reason: There weren’t witnesses. There also wasn’t an explosive Bryan-versus-Darrow confrontation. And <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">the lawyers stuck with the facts.</span>

You’re right; <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">it was a dramatically important case for science education.</span> It gave teachers the freedom to teach truth, to teach well-accepted ideas in public schools. Hard to top that one.

Susan Epperson finished what John Scopes started.

_**SN**_**:** **Today, anti-science attitudes can be found all across society, including in the federal government. What’s the legacy of the Scopes trial? And how did it help get us to our current moment?**

**Moore:** The Scopes trial is looked at as damaging the whole notion of expertise. The judge wouldn’t allow the scientific experts to testify. And we see that now, with experts being shut down.

Everybody has their own microphone now. Anyone can claim to be an expert. True experts are important, so you need to be skeptical of what you hear and search for real expertise.

### Power Words

[More About Power Words](https://www.snexplores.org/power-words-aid-stem-literacy/)

**ad**: Short for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">advertisement</span>. It may appear in any medium (print, online or broadcast) and has been prepared to sell someone on a product, idea or point of view.

**adaptation**: (in biology) The development of new programs, processes, policies and structures to make communities and their inhabitants better able to head off — or at least withstand — the dangerous impacts of a warming climate. Those impacts may include drought, flooding, wildfires, extreme heat and extreme storms.

**agnostic:** Someone who does not know whether a god exists or who may consider it impossible to know that with any certainty. This is different from an atheist, someone who does not believe in a god.

**ancestor**: A predecessor. It could be a family forebear, such as a parent, grandparent or great-great-great grandparent. Or it could be a species, genus, family or other order of organisms from which some later one evolved. For instance, ancient dinosaurs are the ancestors of today's birds. (antonym: descendant)

**ape**: A group of rather large primates, all of which lack a tail. They include <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gorillas</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">chimpanzees</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bonobos</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">orangutans</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gibbons</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">humans</span>. Most people tend to group humans into their own separate subcategory owing to a number of special traits. These include a larger brain, greater mental abilities (including being able to talk) and their ability to walk on two legs.

**biology**: The study of living things. The scientists who study them are known as **biologists**.

**common ancestor**: Also known as shared ancestor. It's an ancestor that two or more descendants have in common. Two siblings share a parent as a common ancestor. This also applies on the level of species and groups of organisms. Two or more species can share a common ancestor at the genus level. Two or more genera can share a common ancestor at the family level, and so on. Tigers and lions have a common ancestor, as do <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">humans</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Neandertals</span>.

**COVID-19**: A name given to the disease that erupted into a massive global pandemic in 2020. It first emerged in 2019 and is caused by a new coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms can include pneumonia, trouble breathing, feeling too tired to walk more than a few steps, fever, headaches, low blood-oxygen levels, blood clots and brain “fog.”

**defense:** (in law) The lawyer(s) acting on behalf of someone accused of a crime — both before trial and in any courtroom proceedings.

**economy**: Term for the combined wealth and resources (people, jobs, land, forests and minerals, for instance) of a nation or region. It is often measured in terms of jobs and income or in terms of the production and use of goods (such as products) and services (for instance, nursing or internet access).

**engineer**: A person who uses science and math to solve problems. As a verb, to engineer means to design a device, material or process that will solve some problem or unmet need.

**environment**: The sum of all of the things that exist around some organism or the process and the condition those things create. Environment may refer to the weather and ecosystem in which some animal lives, or, perhaps, the temperature and humidity (or even the placement of things in the vicinity of an item of interest).

**evolution**: (v. to **evolve**) A process by which species undergo changes over time, usually through genetic variation and natural selection. These changes usually result in a new type of organism better suited for its environment than the earlier type. The newer type is not necessarily more “advanced,” just better adapted to the particular conditions in which it developed. 

**federal**: Of or related to a country’s national government (not to any state or local government within that nation). For instance, the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health are both agencies of the U.S. federal government.

**fundamental**: Something that is basic or serves as the foundation for another thing or idea.

**high school**: A designation for grades nine through 12 in the U.S. system of compulsory public education. High-school graduates may apply to colleges for further, advanced education.

**literally**: An adjective indicating that the phrase it modifies is precisely true. For instance, to say: "_It's so cold that I'm literally dying_," means that this person actually expects to soon be dead, the result of getting too cold.

**media**: A term for the ways information is delivered and shared within a society. It encompasses not only the traditional media — newspapers, magazines, radio and television — but also digital outlets, such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and WhatsApp. The newer, digital media are sometimes referred to as social media. The singular form of this term is medium.

**natural selection**: This is guiding concept underlying evolution, or natural adaptation. It holds that natural mutations within a population of organisms will create some new forms that are better adapted to their environment. That adaptation makes them more likely to survive and reproduce. Over time, these survivors may come to dominate the original population. If their adaptive changes are significant enough, those survivors may also constitute a new species.

**pandemic**: An outbreak of disease that affects a large proportion of the population across much or most of the world. Among the most notable in recent decades was the years-long global COVID-19 pandemic, which was formally proclaimed by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020.

**pathogen**: Short for microorganism. A living thing that is too small to see with the unaided eye, including bacteria, some fungi and many other organisms such as amoebas. Most consist of a single cell.

**pesticide**: A chemical or mix of compounds used to kill insects, rodents or other organisms harmful to cultivated plants, pets or livestock; or unwanted organisms that infest homes, offices, farm buildings and other protected structures.

**politician**: A person who runs for or holds elected office in a town or larger governing body. For politicians, governing people (or organizations) and wielding power within government is a profession (job).

**population**: (in biology) A group of individuals (belonging to the same species) that lives in a given area.

**precursor**: A substance from which some later thing is made. It may be a compound that will change into something else as a result of some chemical or biological reaction.

**prosecution**: (in law) The term for the government’s side in a court case that is charging someone or some organization of a crime. Or the government lawyer(s) who work on the side of any public agency that is accusing someone of a crime.

**religious fundamentalism**: Conservative religious movements that believe much if not all of society can be governed — and the universe understood — by reading and adhering to sacred texts. The term initially developed to describe certain groups of American Protestants who insisted that there were no errors in the Bible (so it could be help up as a primary source of truths). Today the term can be applied to “fundamentalist” subsets of many of the world’s religions.

**resistance**: (as in drug resistance) The reduction in the effectiveness of a drug to cure a disease, usually a microbial infection. (as in disease resistance) The ability of an organism to fight off disease. (as in exercise) A type of rather sedentary exercise that relies on the contraction of muscles to build strength in localized tissues. (in physics) Something that keeps a physical material (such as a block of wood, flow of water or air) from moving freely, usually because it provides friction to impede its motion.

**savvy**: The quality of possessing useful and clever knowledge.

**social**: (adj.) Relating to gatherings of people; a term for animals (or people) that prefer to exist in groups. (noun) A gathering of people, for instance those who belong to a club or other organization, for the purpose of enjoying each other’s company.

**society**: An integrated group of people or animals that generally cooperate and support one another for the greater good of them all.

**Supreme Court**: The highest U.S. court to deal with legal questions about how to interpret the Constitution (the document that spells out how the national government works and what basic rights are), federal laws and treaties, and maritime law. Most cases at the Supreme Court are appeals of the decisions of lower courts. Constitutional issues deal with the rights of individuals, states or others. A few cases can also start there (such as disputes between two states). The Supreme Court has a Chief Justice and eight other justices (they are not called “judges” in this court). The president nominates individuals to serve on the court. Those appointments must then be approved (confirmed) by the U.S. Senate. Justices on this court serve for life, which means as long as they choose and are not found guilty of certain serious offenses.

**theory**: (in science) A description of some aspect of the natural world based on extensive observations, tests and reason. A theory can also be a way of organizing a broad body of knowledge that applies in a broad range of circumstances to explain what will happen. Unlike the common definition of theory, a theory in science is not just a hunch. Ideas or conclusions that are based on a theory — and not yet on firm data or observations — are referred to as theoretical. Scientists who use mathematics and/or existing data to project what might happen in new situations are known as theorists.

**virus**: Tiny infectious particles consisting of genetic material (RNA or DNA) surrounded by protein. Viruses can reproduce only by injecting their genetic material into the cells of living creatures. Although scientists frequently refer to viruses as alive or dead, in fact many scientists agree that viruses are not truly alive. They don’t eat as animals do or make their own food as plants do. A virus must hijack the cellular machinery of a living cell to survive.

**weather**: Conditions in the atmosphere at a localized place and a particular time. It is usually described in terms of particular features, such as air pressure, humidity, moisture, any precipitation (rain, snow or ice), temperature and wind speed. Weather constitutes the actual conditions that occur at any time and place. It’s different from climate, which is a description of the conditions that tend to occur in some general region during a particular month or season.

**World War I**: Also known as WWI and the Great War. This war began in 1914, as two alliances faced off against one another. On one side were the so-called Central Powers — Germany, Bulgaria and the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires. On the other side were the Allies — France, Great Britain, Russia, Italy and, beginning in 1917, the United States.
