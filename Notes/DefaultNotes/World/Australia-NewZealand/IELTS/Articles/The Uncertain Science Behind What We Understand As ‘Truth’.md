IRA FLATOW: This is Science Friday. I’m Ira Flatow. One of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">foundational</span> qualities of the human <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">race</span> is a search for truth. We can <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">trace</span> this through history, from the ancient <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Greeks</span> and their belief in a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">universal</span> truth to early scientists like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Isaac</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Newton</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">uncovering</span> core concepts in physics and math, to our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Founding</span> Fathers writing, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”

Feels like these days, our relationship to the truth is a little different. In a world of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">disinformation</span>, people who have their own different set of facts, the rising influence of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">artificial</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intelligence</span>, where does the truth fit in, and how do we determine what it is? Joining me to discuss is my guest, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Adam</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Kucharski</span>, author of proof the art and science of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">certainty</span>. He’s based in London. Welcome to Science Friday.

ADAM KUCHARSKI: Thank you for having me.

IRA FLATOW: You’re quite welcome. What’s your personal relationship with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">uncertainty</span>? Are you <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">comfortable</span> with it?

ADAM KUCHARSKI: I think it’s something I’ve become <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">increasingly</span> comfortable with. So my background was in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mathematics</span>, which is obviously this world of supposed <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">certainty</span> and proofs that last <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">forever</span>. But increasingly, I’ve moved into the world of real-world data, real-world problems. And I think that’s really made me much more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">aware</span> not only of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">uncertainty</span> we have in trying to work out what’s happening, but also the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">subjectivity</span> that people can have in the level of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">evidence</span> you need to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">eventually</span> act on something.

IRA FLATOW: And where do we set that line?

ADAM KUCHARSKI: It <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">varies</span> quite a lot. One of the things that has kind of become a bit of a tradition in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">statistics</span>– and it can be traced back about a hundred years– is this idea that don’t want to set the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bar</span> too high, because then things that might be interesting or useful, you’ll ignore. But you don’t want to set it too low and let a lot of things that are false through.

And one of the things we’ve seen is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">convergence</span> in statistics, a lot of the medical <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">literature</span>, around this 5% value. You want there, if you’re doing a study, to be a less than 5% chance that you’d get a result as <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">unusual</span>, as <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">extreme</span> as that.

IRA FLATOW: So it’s the 95% certainty.

ADAM KUCHARSKI: Exactly, yeah. And so you see that in medical papers, in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">trials</span>. You see that in experiments. But it’s become this kind of hard <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cutoff</span>. And it was fairly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">arbitrary</span>, how it’s defined. It was actually just because it made the maths a bit easier. But of course, the type of certainty we need varies a lot with the problem. And other <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">statisticians</span> in the 20th century, particularly William <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Gosset</span>, who was working at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Guinness</span>, took a far more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pragmatic</span> outlook.

And they said, well, actually, there shouldn’t be this magic value, above which we’re <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">convinced</span> and below which we’re not. Because it will depend on, well, what’s the benefit of the change we’re potentially going to make? What’s the cost it might have? How hard is it to go out and get more evidence? And I think we see that even in our daily lives, that something that isn’t particularly costly for you to experiment with, you’re probably <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">happier</span> to make that change with lower levels of evidence, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">whereas</span> if something’s going to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">enormously</span> difficult or cause you a lot of headaches if you get it wrong, you’re going to want a higher level of certainty.

IRA FLATOW: But people have a lot of difficulty with uncertainty, don’t they?

ADAM KUCHARSKI: I think it’s something that humans love to go out of their way to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">avoid</span>. There’s even this nice study. It was internally in the CIA in the 1950s. And <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Sherman</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Kent</span>, one of their <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">analysts</span>, had written a report that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">concluded</span> there was a serious possibility that the then <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">USSR</span> might try and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">invade</span> what was then <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Yugoslavia</span>. And when he was talking to others, he realized that everybody had a different notion of what that term <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">meant</span>. And people would talk about <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">probable</span> and possible. And he got quite frustrated cause he said that, actually, people will kind of go out of their way to avoid being <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pinned</span> down on something.

So I think one of it is, if there’s uncertainty about the world, we don’t like having to deal with that. I think also, you can get situations where things can be very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">counterintuitive</span>, even in terms of how you balance different types of errors or how you might want to have to, say, update your belief based on different information. That can often create a lot of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tension</span> because it might not behave in the way we expect it to, either whether we’re trying to for, example, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">convince</span> others.

Or in the case of some medical tests, if you have things where there’s a small false positive and not many people have a disease, your interpretation of that test result might be very different. You might think, oh, I’ve got a positive test. That means I’ve probably got the disease. But actually, the numbers can combine in slightly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nonintuitive</span> ways.

IRA FLATOW: Right. Not only are you a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mathematician</span>, but you’re also an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">epidemiologist</span>. And that opens up a whole <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bunch</span> of stuff to talk about, especially the first few years of the COVID <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pandemic</span>. Tell me how you understood what truth, certainty looked like in those early days.

ADAM KUCHARSKI: Yeah. COVID was just this situation where a lot of this knowledge we, to some extent, had to build from scratch. We had examples of it from other <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pathogens</span>, from other situations. But it was something where you didn’t get the benefit just to wait and see for a few years. In that sort of situation, not making a decision is making a decision.

So a lot of the work that we did was building up that early evidence around everything from the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">severity</span>, the extent of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">superspreading</span>, the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">characteristics</span> of early <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">variants</span>. And I think one of the things, working a lot with evidence to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">inform</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">policy</span>, I became very aware of is that in some cases, you might have quite a lot of uncertainty, but you can still say something useful as a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">conclusion</span>.

So to take the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">emergence</span> of the alpha variant or the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">delta</span> variant, it was extremely hard early on to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pin</span> down exactly how much more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">transmissible</span> it is. It might be 20%. It might be 40%. It might be 60% But actually, all of those give you the same conclusion– that you’re going to be seeing a rising <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">epidemic</span>, and you’re going to be getting into trouble. And so I think for that, again, it was that conversion between something that might feel like quite an uncertain problem, but actually saying, can we at least know which side of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fence</span> we’re on and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">simplify</span> in a way that’s still useful for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">politicians</span>?

I think also, though, because it was such a public <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crisis</span> that affected so many people– and knowledge did <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">emerge</span> over time. I think we saw some examples in real time where there was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">overconfident</span> statements about certain features of the pandemic that worked badly, perhaps because governments didn’t want to acknowledge the unknowns. But on the other hand, sometimes communicating that uncertainty was important because the situation was going to change.

IRA FLATOW: Was that, though, the case? Did public officials communicate this uncertainty <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">successfully</span>, or was there a better way to do this?

ADAM KUCHARSKI: I think we saw some countries do it a bit better. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Particularly</span>, places like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Denmark</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Singapore</span> stood out, where policy was going to have to change. And if you had an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">emerging</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">variant</span>, for example, you might know not the exact risk of that. You have to decide what you’re going to do about it, and then you might want to modify that. And I think they were much better in communicating that this is what we’re going to do at this point in time, and this is what we might update. I think other places were a bit more focused on saying, this is the policy. This is what we’re going to have to do. And then when they <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pivot</span>, people get a little bit <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">confused</span> about that.

IRA FLATOW: Do you think this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ultimately</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">led</span> some people to lose trust with science?

ADAM KUCHARSKI: We’re seeing a bit of a mixed picture because under certain <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">metrics</span>, trust in science is still high relative to a lot of other <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">industries</span>. I think what we’ve seen, though, in recent years is a lot of things <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intertwined</span> together. There’s been useful research in recent years that, often, these things are not just in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">isolation</span>, that your relationship with science or your relationship with public health <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">authorities</span> is going to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">interlinked</span> with your relationship with other <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">institutions</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">judicial</span> systems, governments, and so on.

I think it also links a bit– and I’ve seen it <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">firsthand</span> a lot from people who sent scientists angry messages– in your relationship with wider <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">consensus</span>. So I gave a talk on <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">conspiracy</span> theories earlier in the year. And it was really <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">striking</span> how many of the comments– first of all, there was a lot of detail. This wasn’t just one-off random comments. But it was also– there was this very strong idea of, we’re seeing a truth that other people aren’t seeing. It’s almost a feeling of community underlying it.

So I think there’s a lot of these other dynamics, in terms of how it <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">influences</span> your relationship with power, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">institutions</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">authority</span>. Are you actually this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">community</span> that have this hidden truth? I think there’s a lot of other dimensions beyond just pure trust in a scientific fact.

IRA FLATOW: Well, you, as a scientist, are you <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">frustrated</span> with the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">politics</span> of truth here?

ADAM KUCHARSKI: I think one of the things that becomes very challenging is where scientific evidence and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">political</span> choices get very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">intertwined</span>. And I think an obvious example of that is where science is either <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">constrained</span> or undermined to seek a sort of political or commercial goal. And I think that’s what we’ve seen if you look back at things like smoking, for example, a huge effort to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">undermine</span> a lot of the scientific evidence.

I think it also becomes challenging– I think we saw during COVID, follow the science was this sort of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mantra</span>. And I think a lot of it was essentially <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">politicians</span> using it as cover for not having to make very difficult decisions. The science could only take you so far. And I think one of the things that we were always thinking a lot about how to present is, you have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">essentially</span> a series of bad options. And I think anyone who says that there was a simple solution to the pandemic is wrong, that there was a bunch of very difficult <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">trade</span>-offs.

And actually, even if you look back to the 1918 pandemic, it’s fascinating how many of those newspaper <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">quotes</span> you could have just pulled out of 2020. It’s just arguing about which bits of society should be valued in different ways. And then it’s very much on politicians to make those decisions and, yeah, as a society to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">weigh</span> those things up.

And I think, increasingly, a lot of that has got <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bedded</span> more on, that was a scientific choice, when actually, science can’t weigh up all of those features of society in those kind of ways. And in my view, I don’t think it should. I think something like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">epidemiology</span> is one thread contributing to that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wider</span>, very difficult decision.

IRA FLATOW: Well, we’re seeing that not only <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">medically</span>, but we’re seeing that with the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">environmental</span> situation, with the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">denial</span> of climate change and the climate <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crisis</span>, like, oh, don’t look over there. Let’s just ignore that and do away with it, like it doesn’t exist.

ADAM KUCHARSKI: Yeah. It’s also just really striking, the levels that the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">disagreements</span> have. And I think if you look at something like climate change, I think the healthy <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">debate</span> is where you have the documented evidence about the situation we’re facing. You have the evidence which has a lot more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">uncertainty</span> about what we might do about it. And then you have the policy decision about what we should do about it.

And I think that was one of the things that was striking– I talked to quite a lot of climate scientists for the book– that there is very good scientific <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">consensus</span> on the what is happening. There’s less consensus on, of all these policy <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">levers</span>, exactly which ones are going to have which effect, what should we be doing about it. But I think what’s been happening, as you say, is that people have gone back to those <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fundamentals</span> and rather than having debates– and perhaps because they don’t like some of those changes that can be required– they go down more fundamentally.

And we see that with other interventions as well, that I think, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">understandably</span>, for COVID, there were some people who were not very keen on things like vaccine <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mandates</span> because it was seen as an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">infringement</span> of freedom. But rather than just talking about the policy, it went back to, OK, well, vaccines don’t work, or claims that the pathogen itself isn’t very severe at all.

And I think, ultimately, it’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dislike</span> for the policy, which then you get people trying to target the system further down instead, even though for something, whether we’re talking about the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">severity</span> of something like COVID or the extent of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hazard</span> that climate change is facing, that foundational evidence is very strong.

IRA FLATOW: There are a lot of things about science and medicine that we don’t the truth behind. Simple things like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">anesthesia</span>– we know it works. We don’t how– same goes for some medicines. And in physics, we know quantum physics works but not why. Richard <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Feynman</span>, a very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wellknown</span> and respected <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Nobel</span> Prize <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">scientist</span>, said, if any scientist tells you they why it happens, they’re lying. So we know it works, but we don’t know why. Should we still consider these things the truth, even if we can’t verify the why?

ADAM KUCHARSKI: I think that’s a really good point. And I think it gets to the heart, actually, a lot of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tension</span> with our interactions with technology, and particularly in the modern <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">era</span>, the extent to which it’s important to have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">confidence</span> that something works versus that understanding of why something works. And also, it really just gets to the heart of what is science in the modern era.

As you said, there’s elements of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">medicine</span> where we don’t understand exactly all the underlying processes. But we have confidence if we do this, we’ll get this effect. And even if you run a clinical <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">trial</span>, it will tell you, with often good <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">confidence</span>, whether or not something has the effect you’re testing. But it won’t<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)"> </span><span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">necessarily</span> give you that why you need to get that from other sources.

And I think in other fields, in things like AI, for example, people are much more uncomfortable with, say, self-driving cars that have accidents that we can’t explain. So even if a self-driving car was, on average, much safer than a human– which isn’t, let’s be honest, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">massively</span> difficult, because humans do a lot of very strange, unhelpful things when they’re driving– I think there would still be that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">discomfort</span> about that kind of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lack</span> of understanding.

And I think we’ve also seen it talking to scientists who’ve worked on a lot of AI <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">discoveries</span>, so some of the protein prediction work, where I think– and I’ve certainly had it myself– that growing up with science, you have this idea that there’s a really <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">elegant</span> theory, and you can understand it. I think even the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mathematician</span> in me– you want to get pen and paper out and solve it, or you want to be able to do the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tangible</span> experiment.

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Abraham</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Lincoln</span>, for example, taught himself all the Greek <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mathematical</span> proofs because he wanted to get better at demonstrating things. And that era has kind of moved on. And we’re very much going to an era, both in maths– a lot of the proofs that involve computers now and can’t really be easily verified by hand– or in AI <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">discovery</span> and science, where there isn’t that simple <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">explanation</span>.

But we can have predictions that can be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">enormously</span> powerful and still having to come to terms with, well, this is science. And just as we have these medical tools that are very valuable, we can have scientific discoveries we can have confidence in. But we lose, perhaps, a little bit of that kind of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">romanticism</span> around the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">elegance</span> of our explanations.

IRA FLATOW: Right. Well, as we go forward into this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">technological</span> future, are there any lessons we can take from our <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">predecessors</span>?

ADAM KUCHARSKI: I think one of the things that really stands out for me is the dangers of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">assuming certainty</span>. I think we’ve seen it in recent years with this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">assumption</span> that certain algorithms have reached <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">superhuman</span> status, for example, in games, which are very well defined, should, in theory, be a perfect starting point for AI to reach that kind of mastery– that, actually, people who <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">poked</span> around have found that that’s not true. And I think there’s an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">analogy</span> there, even going back about 150 years with that assumed idea that maths had solved it all, and we had these universal truths. And people start to poke around and find examples where that doesn’t work.

I think also, being really aware of those balances we’ve got to strike– even in discussion of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">misinformation</span>, we focus a lot on not wanting people to believe <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">falsehoods</span>. But there’s two errors you can make with information. One is believing things are false, but another is not believing things that are true. And so there’s, I think, increasing <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">awareness</span> that interventions that focus just on false information might work, but they do it by just reducing belief in all information.

So we need to focus on the fact that, for many of these problems, there’s actually two errors in many cases that we need to be balancing. And we don’t <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">inadvertently</span> want to intervene on one but also <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">undermine</span> our trust in other information systems along the way.
