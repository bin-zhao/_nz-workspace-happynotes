IRA FLATOW: This is Science Friday. I’m Ira Flatow. One of my <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">favorite</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sites</span> of summer is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fireflies</span>. You know, their <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">magical</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">blinking</span> lights serving as tiny <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">beacons</span> in the warm, dark night. Who could <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">resist</span> catching one, right? Because their light comes from <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bodily</span> chemicals, the special way that fireflies light up has long been used as a research tool in medicine, driving scientists to better <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">illuminate</span> the inner workings of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">beetle</span>. And as such, researchers have recently discovered that fireflies’ glowing <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lanterns</span> are just one of the ways they <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">communicate</span>.

Joining me now to talk about the latest firefly science are my guests, Dr. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Sarah</span> Lower, Associate Professor of Biology at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Bucknell</span> University, based in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Lewisburg</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Pennsylvania</span>. Dr. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Stephen</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Miller</span>, Professor of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Biochemistry</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Molecular</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Biotechnology</span> at the University of Mass Chan Medical School, based in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Worcester</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Massachusetts</span>. Welcome to Science Friday.

SARAH LOWER: Thank you so much.

STEPHEN MILLER: Thank you

IRA FLATOW: Sarah, I wanted to start with an overview of the firefly population. I’ve seen some reports that fireflies are making a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">comeback</span>. I didn’t even know they were in danger.

SARAH LOWER: So what most people don’t realize is that there are more than 2000 species of fireflies. I think we’re up to 2,628, and each of these firefly species has its own <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">habitat</span> requirements. So there are some species that are quite <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">abundant</span>. I’m thinking about the common Eastern Firefly, here on the eastern part of the United States. This one is usually the one that people see when they are out on their <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">porch</span> in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">summertime</span>. They’re active around <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sunset</span> and they can be quite <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">abundant</span>.

IRA FLATOW: Right.

SARAH LOWER: But there are other species that are much more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rare</span>, and those are the ones that we are particularly concerned about.

IRA FLATOW: Now, what determines how good a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">quote</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">unquote</span> “<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crop</span> of fireflies” we have in any one year? Are there environmental issues?

SARAH LOWER: That’s a great question. Based on some work that we’ve done, using data from folks such as yourself who log their firefly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sightings</span> in an app, we were able to identify that weather, in both the current year as well as in previous years, is really important in determining firefly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">abundance</span>. So fireflies spend one to two years in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">larval</span> stage. And so if the factors a year ago– if the weather a year ago was not very great, they can actually delay their pupation to become an adult.

IRA FLATOW: What if it’s really <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rainy</span> out? Does that affect the population?

SARAH LOWER: Some of the reports that we’ve been hearing this year from people, especially in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mid-Atlantic</span> area, have been that fireflies have been super abundant this year and some of that could be linked to rain. So in other parts of the country where there’s been <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">drought</span>, there haven’t been too many fireflies <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">observed</span>. But we’ve been hearing <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">anecdotes</span> from people in New York, in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Pennsylvania</span>, that there are just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bumper</span> crops of fireflies this year.

IRA FLATOW: Yeah Well, what about fireflies in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">urban</span> areas? Do they live a different life, have a different population dynamic?

SARAH LOWER: So I just got done with the International Firefly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Symposium</span> in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Tlaxcala</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Mexico</span>. And–

IRA FLATOW: There is such a thing?

SARAH LOWER: There is. And anyone who is a firefly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">enthusiast</span>, scientist, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">educator</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">storyteller</span>, artist is welcome to come and contribute. One of the things that came out of that conference is that there are firefly populations in urban areas. I myself have collected fireflies in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">DuPont</span> Circle, in Washington, DC. So this is a highly populated area with lots of traffic and hard surfaces and light pollution, all of which are things that we don’t think of as firefly friendly.

Research from this conference suggests that, in other places in the world where they have these urban firefly populations, they’re actually <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">remnants</span> of populations from a long time ago, and that the area that they are in is the remnant forest that used to be there. And so it’s really important to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">conserve</span> those populations because they’re going to be really hard to get back if they blink out.

IRA FLATOW: Wow, that is very interesting. You’ve <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">segued</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nicely</span> into my next topic, the blinking part. Steve, as I mentioned at the top, fireflies’ glowing <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">lanterns</span> have a lot of medical research applications. But before we get into that, can you explain the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">chemistry</span>, the chemical reaction, the cold light, so to speak, that fireflies light up with?

STEPHEN MILLER: Yeah, so fireflies are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">beetles</span> that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">chemically</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">emit</span> light when an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">enzyme</span>, they produce, firefly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">luciferase</span>, acts upon a small molecule they make called <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">D-luciferin</span>, to produce an excited state molecule called <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">oxyluciferin</span>. So here, they’re using the chemical energy of oxygen to access this excited state. And when that molecule drops down to the ground state, you get the emission of a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">photon</span> of light. And that’s the yellow-green light you see from the firefly.

IRA FLATOW: So why fireflies glow up. But do other insects or animals have this ability also, Steve?

STEPHEN MILLER: Yeah. So there are many other <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bioluminescent</span> fireflies, as Sarah mentioned. There are other beetles that are capable of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bioluminescence</span>. So the enzyme, firefly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">luciferase</span>, is thought to have evolved from a family of proteins that operate on <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fatty</span> acids that are present in all insects. And so we were, in particular, were studying fruit flies. And we asked, could fruit flies be capable of bioluminescence? And we asked this because the fruit fly enzyme that operates on fatty acids is 40% identical to firefly luciferase.

But <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mercifully</span>, fruit flies do not glow in the dark.

IRA FLATOW: [LAUGHS]

STEPHEN MILLER: They do not make D-luciferin. And if you take that enzyme from the fruit fly and you give it D-luciferin, nothing happens. But in our lab, we make many <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">synthetic</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">luciferin</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">analogs</span> to change the properties of light emission. And we found if we take the fruit fly enzyme and we treat it with one of the molecules we made in the lab, that it would glow. It would emit light. So no change to the enzyme. We just give it a new <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">substrate</span> and we see light emission.

IRA FLATOW: That must have been spooky.

STEPHEN MILLER: It was spooky, but it was cool, because we’re also trying to see whether this could apply beyond insects into, say, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mammals</span>, like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mice</span> or even humans. Because we have those same types of enzymes in our body. They’re not as closely related to firefly luciferase. But in principle, if you could make a molecule that was a substrate for one of those enzymes, we might be capable of light emission as well.

IRA FLATOW: I’m just letting that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sink</span> in for a second. Where– would you use it internally as a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">diagnostic</span>, or how would you use it?

STEPHEN MILLER: This is not going to be, like, a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rave</span> party drug. You’re not going to be glowing or something. But instead, it’s something that potentially could be used for getting signals from <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mammalian</span> cells or tissues, and being able to create reporters of particular <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">enzymatic</span> activity that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">utilize</span> a potential <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">endogenous</span> luciferase activity.

IRA FLATOW: Mhm. Now Sarah, let’s get back to talking about why fireflies light up to begin with. We’ve all been told that this is a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mating</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ritual</span>, right?

SARAH LOWER: Yes. So each firefly species has its own flash pattern that it does, sort of like a code, a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Morse</span> code that they use to identify, locate, and choose mates. It’s also used potentially for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">deterring</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">predators</span>. All fireflies light up in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">larval</span> stage. So they’re not using light for mating at that point. They don’t have reproductive organs at that point in their lives. What we think they’re using it for then, is what we call an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">aposematic</span> signal, or a warning signal. It’s like this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">neon</span> sign saying, don’t eat me, I’m <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">toxic</span>. It’s an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">antipredator</span> signal.

IRA FLATOW: Don’t eat me. I’m <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">poisonous</span>.

SARAH LOWER: I’m toxic. There was an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">estimate</span> from <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Thomas</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Eisner</span>, who first was looking at <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">toxicity</span>, and he estimated that you would have to eat about 20 fireflies to die, as the average human.

IRA FLATOW: Wow.

SARAH LOWER: I do not recommend that.

IRA FLATOW: Do not try this at home, right?

SARAH LOWER: Yeah There was a time when I <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">accidentally</span> got some firefly reflex <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bleeding</span> on me. So this is another antipredator behavior that they do. If a predator grabs them, or if a human grabs them a little too hard, you’ll see them <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ooze</span> a bit of a white, sticky substance from part of their body.

IRA FLATOW: Right.

SARAH LOWER: And that’s actually the insect <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">equivalent</span> of blood.

IRA FLATOW: Hmm.

SARAH LOWER: And if you get that on you, on your hands, and accidentally, say, touch your face, you might <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">taste</span> something really <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gross</span> and your lips might go <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">numb</span>. So I do not <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">recommend</span>, based on personal experience, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">licking</span> fireflies or doing any of that.

IRA FLATOW: Wow. You recently published a study about how fireflies use their sense of smell to communicate. I mean, who knows? I always assumed that they only communicate with their flashing light <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bulb</span>.

SARAH LOWER: Yeah. Most people, when you think of fireflies, think of summer nights filled with flashing lights. But actually, there are many species around the world who have lost the ability to light up in the adult stage, and they come out during the day. So even if they could light up, light isn’t going to be very successful. Think about using a flashlight during the day. And so these species, we think, use smell to communicate.

They’re using a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pheromone</span> that females emit and males can follow through the air back to the female.

IRA FLATOW: How do you discover that they could smell? I mean, you can’t ask a firefly, right?

SARAH LOWER: So a lot of insects use smell for mating. A lot of the time, you can look at their behavior. So in fireflies, they’ve done experiments where you stick females out in a dish out in a field, and males will just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">flock</span> to this female, even if they can’t see her, suggesting that their smell.

Or you can look at their <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">antennae</span>. So some fireflies have these <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">gorgeous</span>, what we call <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">plumose</span> antennae. And they’re very <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">elaborate</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">flamboyant</span> and branched. They look like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">antlers</span>. And that’s a sign that maybe smell is really important, because they’re increasing the surface area of their <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">antenna</span>, which is the smell organ in an insect.

IRA FLATOW: Very cool. Steve, let’s go back to talking about <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bioluminescence</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">luciferin</span> used for medical research. Can you give me a little <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">capsule</span> of what it’s being used for?

STEPHEN MILLER: So bioluminescence is a great way to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">spy</span> on otherwise invisible processes that are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">occurring</span> in live cells and animals. So it’s frequently used to monitor cell growth, such as the growth of a tumor in an animal, or the expression level of different genes, where the intensity of the bioluminescence <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">corresponds</span> to how highly the gene is being expressed. We’ve done things, and others– people have modified <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">luciferins</span> in order to make them report on different specific <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">enzymes</span> within cells or within animals.

They can also be used to detect, say, metals or small molecules, other things that you wouldn’t normally be able to see, but you link them to the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bioluminescent</span> light reaction. And that intensity and location tells you where and how much that enzyme, or small molecule, is being produced. Lots of things you would use for, say, drug development and testing.

IRA FLATOW: I understand that you’re working on making even better bioluminescent methods by changing the color of the light, its frequency. Tell me about that.

STEPHEN MILLER: Yeah, so the yellow-green light you see in the fireflies, it’s based on the structure of the luciferin molecule that the firefly makes. And we’ve made many <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">synthetic</span> analogs of luciferin, where we’ve designed it to be a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">substrate</span>, but to emit light at longer <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wavelengths</span>. And often, the luciferase enzyme is <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">promiscuous</span> enough to accept these molecules.

And so this is useful, in particular, if you’re imaging in live animal. You want to redshift the light output as much as possible because yellow-green light doesn’t <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">penetrate</span> very deeply through tissue. Red light penetrates more, But. The best would be in just beyond the visible wavelength region, in what’s called the near-<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">infrared</span>. And that’s where tissue is most transparent to light. So any bioluminescence you have in that region will penetrate better through tissue, allow you to image deeper within the organism, and be more sensitive.

IRA FLATOW: Very interesting. Sarah, as we get close to wrapping up, I want to know if you have some advice for folks who want to attract fireflies to their <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">backyards</span> this summer.

SARAH LOWER: If you’d like to attract fireflies to your yard this summer, the best thing to do is to turn out your lights.

IRA FLATOW: Really, they don’t like– they don’t like your light being on. Don’t <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">compete</span> with them.

SARAH LOWER: Light <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pollution</span> is a problem for fireflies.

IRA FLATOW: Yeah.

SARAH LOWER: As you can imagine, if there’s a really big light source in the area, any females that are replying to males can’t be seen, and so <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mating</span> doesn’t happen and you don’t get the next generation. In addition, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">larvae</span> on the ground that are also using light as this antipredator <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">defense</span>, their light is not going to be seen. And so they might have some problems as well. So please, just turn off your lights during firefly time.

Other things you can do would be to create dark spaces in your yard. So maybe you can plant some tall trees or tall <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bushes</span>. Maybe there’s part of your yard that you can leave with tall grass. We know that fireflies really need <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">moisture</span>. And so having areas of your yard that are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">moist</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">organic</span>, rich, and dark is the way to go.

IRA FLATOW: Can our listeners be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">citizen</span> scientists here and report what they see someplace?

SARAH LOWER: We would love folks to help us learn more about where and when fireflies occur. In North America, there’s a project called Firefly <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Atlas</span> that’s run out of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Xerxes</span> Society. And this is a website where you can go and you can tell us when and where you have seen fireflies. And it’s added to this growing database of sightings that then scientists like me and my <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">collaborators</span>, we can take that data and we can use it to model fireflies and where they occur.

IRA FLATOW: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Fascinating</span>. Fascinating. And you have still a whole lot of hot weather and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">summertime</span> left to go out and catch them.

SARAH LOWER: I am hoping.

IRA FLATOW: People still catch them?

SARAH LOWER: Yeah, they are. I saw them out last night. If everything is good and it remains warm and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">moist</span>, a few years ago, I saw them all the way to October, in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Pennsylvania</span>.

IRA FLATOW: You shouldn’t keep them in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">jar</span> forever, right?

SARAH LOWER: We do not advise keeping them in the jar forever. Catch and release is what we would like, if you must catch. Most firefly species that we think about only live for about two weeks as an adult in the wild.

IRA FLATOW: Wow.

SARAH LOWER: So they have 14 nights to find each other. And in those 14 nights, some species are only active for about 30 minutes. So if you keep them in a jar for one night, you are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dramatically</span> decreasing their opportunity to find a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mate</span>.

IRA FLATOW: Do not fool around with firefly romance here.

SARAH LOWER: Exactly.

IRA FLATOW: Let it happen. Thank you, Dr. Lower, for taking time to be with us today.

SARAH LOWER: You’re very welcome.

IRA FLATOW: Dr. Sarah Lower, Associate Professor of Biology at Bucknell University, based in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. Doctor Miller, thank you also for taking time.

STEPHEN MILLER: Thanks for having me on.

IRA FLATOW: You’re welcome. Dr. Stephen Miller, Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biotechnology at the UMass Chan Medical School, based in Worcester, Massachusetts.
