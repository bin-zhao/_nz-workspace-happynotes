[AUDIO LOGO]

IRA FLATOW: This is Science Friday. I’m Ira Flatow. Earlier this week, a lake formed by the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">melting</span> of Alaska’s Mendenhall Glacier <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">threatened</span> to flood one of the state’s largest cities, its <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">capital</span>, Juneau. The flood reached a record-breaking <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">crest</span> of nearly 17 feet, and it had the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">potential</span> to be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">catastrophic</span>. But you know what? After years of flooding, Juneau was prepared for this one. And their <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">preparations</span> may have saved many homes and lives.

Here to discuss this and other climate news of the week is Casey Crownhart, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Senior</span> Climate Reporter for MIT Technology Review in New York. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Casey</span>, welcome back to Science Friday.

CASEY CROWNHART: Thanks. Always so <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wonderful</span> to be here.

IRA FLATOW: Tell us about this flood. What happened?

CASEY CROWNHART: Yeah. So like you said, this was a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pretty</span> big <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">glacial</span> flood in Alaska. This is of becoming more common because of climate change. Basically, what happens is, as <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">glaciers</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">melt</span>, they often <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">retreat</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">uphill</span>. And they leave behind these <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">glacial</span> lakes, which are these lakes of glacial <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">meltwater</span>. And they often have walls made of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">loose</span> dirt, and rock, and ice. And those can break, which sends water <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">downhill</span>, sometimes pretty quickly.

Since 1990, the number, and area, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">volume</span> of these lakes around the world have all grown by about 50%. So we’re seeing more of this as the climate <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">warms</span> up. Also, like you mentioned, the good news is that this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">community</span> was pretty prepared for this. So while we did see record-breaking floods, there was very little damage and very little by way of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rescue</span> efforts needed.

IRA FLATOW: When you say it was prepared, what do you mean by that?

CASEY CROWNHART: Yeah, so this has become an issue in this area pretty much every year since 2011. They’ve seen that this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">glacier</span> causes flooding like this. It has gotten worse in recent years. But the local <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">officials</span> have been able to keep an eye on this lake, use weather data, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">monitor</span> it closely.

So they have a good idea of when this is going to happen. And so the community has installed a lot of flood <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">protections</span> to help so that there’s a lot of Hesco <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">barriers</span> that they put out this year. So those are cloth bags with sand or dirt and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reinforced</span> that can help with flood control. And so that’s really a big reason why the flooding didn’t cause more damage than it did.

IRA FLATOW: And these glacial lakes are increasing in size, right? I mean, all over the world, we have them.

CASEY CROWNHART: Absolutely. So I mean, the number of these lakes, the size of them, and just how many there are around the world have all been going up in the last few <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">decades</span>, according to a recent study. So we’re going to see more flooding like this around the world because of climate change.

IRA FLATOW: Has Juneau thought about creating a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dam</span> for the lake?

CASEY CROWNHART: There’s talk of putting more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">permanent</span> flood barriers in. These Hesco barriers are a really good <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">temporary</span> solution, but it’s a lot of work to put them up and take them down every time. So that’s something that they’re <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">definitely</span> looking into because it’s basically an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">annual</span> problem at this point.

---

IRA FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">covereing</span> your wide world of climate change, I know that EVs have been in your sights. And they have been a target for the Trump administration. What happened in the last few months? Not good news for EVs.

CASEY CROWNHART: Yeah, it’s been quite the year to be covering <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">electric</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vehicles</span>, for sure. So what we’ve seen this year is this pretty <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dramatic</span> shift in what <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">policy</span> looks like in the US for EVs. So one of the biggest things is people might remember that there are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tax</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">credits</span> in place right now, up to $7,500 for people looking to buy new electric vehicles. Those now <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">expire</span> at the end of September. Originally, they were designed to go out for years. The <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">federal</span> government, with new <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">legislation</span>, rolled those back.

The EPA is proposing a rollback of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tailpipe</span> rules. Basically, those are the regulation that makes <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">automakers</span> produce vehicles that don’t produce as much <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pollution</span>. And so we’re just seeing, from regulations to this public support, just a really dramatic <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reversal</span>, a lot of rollbacks and support for electric vehicles in particular.

IRA FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So EVs are going to lose the tax credit. I guess there’s worry that the whole EV market may be in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">jeopardy</span>.

CASEY CROWNHART: There’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">definitely</span> a lot of worry. And I honestly think we’re starting to see the early signs of that. So when all of these tax credits, and supports, and regulations were in place last year, some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">estimates</span> predicted that electric vehicles would make up half of new vehicle sales in the US by 2030.

Now, a lot of those estimates are more like 25%– so a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pretty</span> dramatic change. And actually, in the second <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">quarter</span> of this year– so from <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">April</span> to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">June</span>– there were fewer new EVs sold in the US compared to the same period last year. And so in a time where we have pretty much only seen electric vehicle sales growing, that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">contraction</span> in the US is pretty dramatic.

IRA FLATOW: Yeah. You say, in the US, because around the world, they’re selling like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hotcakes</span>.

CASEY CROWNHART: Absolutely. China is right about to hit that 50% mark for electric vehicle sales, which is pretty <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wild</span>.

IRA FLATOW: Yeah, it is. But <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">despite</span> all of this here, Ford recently doubled down on its EV <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">manufacturing</span>. What’s the company working on?

CASEY CROWNHART: Yeah, so the company <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">announced</span> on Monday that they have plans for a new <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">affordable</span> electric truck. The company says that it’ll start at around $30,000, and they plan to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">deliver</span> in 2027. Around that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">announcement</span>, they also said they have this new manufacturing process. Basically, they’re trying to make a shared platform, this set of parts and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">procedures</span> so that they can make this truck, other trucks, SUVs, and do it more cheaply and more efficiently.

IRA FLATOW: Now, Henry Ford <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">invented</span> the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">assembly</span> line back in the Model T age. They’re <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reinventing</span> the assembly line, are they not?

CASEY CROWNHART: Yeah, they’re calling it the assembly tree. So the idea is that they have a couple of different lines on the floor. So make the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cab</span> in one part, the back of the truck in another part. And then those will come together later on in the factory so that you can, again, make these vehicles more efficiently. The company is saying that this is going to be something that really helps them with their EV sales.

IRA FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And of course, part of EVs, the big part of EVs or probably half the value are the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">batteries</span>. And the batteries are a huge part of the Clean Energy <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">transition</span>. And you recently reported on a startup that’s using Earth as a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">giant</span> battery, right?

CASEY CROWNHART: Yeah.

IRA FLATOW: Tell me about that. Yeah.

CASEY CROWNHART: A very different sort of battery. So there’s this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Texas</span>-based startup called <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Quidnet</span> that recently showed that it can store energy in the Earth for months at a time. And basically, they do this by <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pumping</span> water underground. One of the most common ways to store <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">electricity</span> today is pumped <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hydropower</span>. It’s a very old method of storing energy. When electricity is available, you pump water <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">uphill</span>. And then when you want that electricity back, you allow the water to flow <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">downhill</span> and through a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">turbine</span> to generate the electricity again.

This is the same kind of idea, just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">flipped</span> upside down. So you can just pump water down. And then when you want electricity, you allow it to come back up. It gives you more <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">flexibility</span> of where you would put this sort of equipment.

IRA FLATOW: Wow.

CASEY CROWNHART: Yeah, it’s really interesting. The company just completed a six-month test that showed that they were able to store energy for that long and not lose any of it.

IRA FLATOW: And this was really an important amount of energy, not just a few Watts?

CASEY CROWNHART: I would say, it’s still on the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pilot</span> scale, for sure. So they <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">discharged</span> 35 <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">megawatt</span> hours of energy. That would be about 1,000 <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">household</span>’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">worth</span> of electricity for a day. Really big battery storage <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">facilities</span> are tens or hundreds of times bigger than this. But for a pilot phase, it’s pretty interesting. One big <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">caveat</span> is that they still need to build all of the equipment to turn that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pressurized</span> water back into electricity. That should come online in early 2026.

IRA FLATOW: Details, details. So it could be scalable. But right now, it’s not replacing those old batteries.

CASEY CROWNHART: Yeah, absolutely. I think that when it comes to energy storage, I think the more solutions, the better. Maybe batteries will work for one area or one application, and this might work somewhere else. It’s not going to replace batteries, by any means.

IRA FLATOW: Yeah. Well, speaking of batteries, I understand that New York City is testing <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">portable</span> home batteries during these hot summer months for air <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">conditioners</span>. Can that work?

CASEY CROWNHART: Mm-hmm.

IRA FLATOW: What’s going on here?

CASEY CROWNHART: Yeah. So, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">folks</span> in New York or wherever you are might get a text from your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">utility</span> on these hot days, saying, hey, can you turn your air conditioner down? And so to help this, there’s this new <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pilot</span> program called <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Responsible</span> Grid, where basically what they’re doing is giving <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">residents</span> a small battery about the size of a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">microwave</span> that they can plug their AC unit into. And the company controls this remotely <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">via</span> software.

And so when demand is really high on the grid, and it’s really stressed, and we’re really working at our limits, you can run your AC off the battery instead. And you can get paid to do it. Right now, it’s a really small program. But this kind of idea of trying to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shave</span> off demand at those really high peaks is getting really popular. And there’s, I would say, a growing number of programs trying to do things like this.

IRA FLATOW: Yeah, it sounds like a take on people who have solar panels and charge their battery up and then become part of the grid. This is a little different.

CASEY CROWNHART: Absolutely. And whether it’s like that, like solar panels and the batteries, or this kind of program, this kind of distributed model is really interesting because we could put these big batteries, whether it’s the Earth battery or more typical battery storage solutions on the grid. But it can take a long time to build those. It can take a long time to get <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">permits</span>. So this is a way to get around that. You can do a lot of these little projects instead.

IRA FLATOW: Before we go, I want to talk about nuclear power. We know that France really has lots of nuclear power plants. But a plant in France was shut down by a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">swarm</span> of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">jellyfish</span>.

CASEY CROWNHART: Yes. This was a pretty wild story this week. So a major nuclear plant in France had to shut down. They had four <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reactors</span> shut down between Sunday night and Monday morning after jellyfish appeared in their cooling system. So a lot of nuclear power plants will use either seawater or water from a river to help cool down the reactors. And in this case, it seems like the jellyfish got by the screens that are designed to keep animals from ending up in these <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">facilities</span>. And so these reactors all had to shut down.

IRA FLATOW: Oh, so this is not some out-of-a-movie thing. We had the attack of the giant jellyfish, right?

CASEY CROWNHART: [LAUGHS] No, no. No worries about them being <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">radioactive</span> or anything. It’s in the non-nuclear part of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">facility</span>.

IRA FLATOW: And why did this happen now?

CASEY CROWNHART: Yeah. It’s a little tough to say. But one thing that we do is that higher ocean <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">temperatures</span> can be associated with more jellyfish. <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Overfishing</span> also can lead to more jellyfish because not as many <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">predators</span>. And so we’ve seen record-breaking heat waves this year again, especially in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Europe</span>. And so some experts say that because of climate change, we might be seeing more jellyfish and could lead to more problems like this.

IRA FLATOW: Well, we’ve always heard stories about how fish like to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">congregate</span> where the water comes out of a power plant because it’s a lot warmer. Maybe this is sort of a case of that.

IRA FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah it’s really interesting how the nuclear power plant becomes part of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ecosystem</span>, almost. I think it’s really <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fascinating</span>.

IRA FLATOW: Well, you’ve always been fascinating for us, Casey. Thank you–

CASEY CROWNHART: [LAUGHS]

IRA FLATOW: –for taking time to be with us today.

CASEY CROWNHART: Thanks so much for having me.

We have to take a break. And when we come back, what the HHS decision to pull back on mRNA <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">vaccine</span> research means for science. Stay with us.

IRA FLATOW: Last week, Health <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Secretary</span> Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. announced that the Department of Health and Human Services would <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">terminate</span> almost $500 million in mRNA vaccine development <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">grants</span> and contracts. Here to explain what this means for mRNA research beyond those immediate grants is Dr. Jeff Coller, Professor of RNA Biology and Therapeutics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He’s studied mRNA for more than 30 years. Welcome to Science Friday.

JEFF COLLER: Thank you.

IRA FLATOW: You and your team’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">discoveries</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">contributed</span> to Moderna’s mRNA vaccine. What was your reaction to last week’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">announcement</span>?

JEFF COLLER: Well, I was completely <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">baffled</span> and really thought it was probably one of the most <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reckless</span> decisions I’ve seen come from the HHS. This technology has <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">literally</span> saved millions of people’s lives and has such <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tremendous</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">potential</span> to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">revolutionize</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">medicine</span>. Most scientists, like me and others, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">appreciate</span> the power of the mRNA medicine platform and what it’s able to do not only for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">infectious</span> disease, but for cancer and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rare</span> disease. It was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shocking</span> to me that a decision could be made that was clearly based on <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">political</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">motivations</span> and not based on hard science.

IRA FLATOW: So the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">promise</span> of mRNA technology is what?

JEFF COLLER: Well, I mean, there’s a lot here, OK? Let’s talk a little bit about what mRNA is. So in your cell, you have DNA. That’s your <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">genes</span>. That contains all the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">genetic</span> information that makes you you. And in order to express those genes, you have to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">transmit</span> information.

So if you think about your genes as a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">restaurant</span>, there are individual <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">recipes</span> that have to be made. And each mRNA is like a recipe card that’s telling your cell how to make a particular recipe. So with the mRNA technology, we’ve really tapped into this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fundamental</span> natural process that <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">occurs</span> in your body. Your body makes mRNAs all the time and is using it to make very specific instructions, very specific recipes.

And so we are using that tool to do all kinds of things. So it’s very powerful in vaccine development for <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">infectious</span> disease. But it’s also being investigated for the treatment of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">debilitating</span> cancers, like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pancreatic</span> cancer, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">glioblastoma</span>, and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">triple</span>-negative breast cancer, as well as the treatment of ultra-rare and rare genetic <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">disorders</span>, like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">muscular</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dystrophy</span> or <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cystic</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fibrosis</span>.

So by limiting the use of this technology in the United States, we’re really <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">hindering</span> our ability to do these sort of medical <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">miracles</span>, really, that all scientists and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">physicians</span> are really seeing as potentially life-saving and life-changing over the next two or three decades.

IRA FLATOW: Hmm. And I know that last week’s announcement <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">impacts</span> 22 existing mRNA vaccine development projects from universities, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">biotech</span> companies, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pharma</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Pfizer</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Moderna</span>. Will this have much of an effect on mRNA research beyond those projects?

JEFF COLLER: Oh, sure. I mean, it’s not so much about the money. It’s the action of what was done. It really was a shot across the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bow</span>, a warning from the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">federal</span> government that this is a technology that we don’t <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">appreciate</span> and that we don’t want in the United States. And if you’re an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">academic</span> institution who has to write a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">grant</span> that would have to be approved by the NIH, or if you’re a company that’s developing a drug, that would have to be approved by the FDA, all of which is under the general <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">auspices</span> of the HHS, you’re going to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wonder</span>, are they going to continue to support this activity?

Companies need money to develop drugs. Drugs are expensive. And so they <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rely</span> upon <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">venture</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">capital</span> and other sources of income. And if those are just not available because people are <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">skittish</span> about the technology, then those activities will be moved outside of the United States.

IRA FLATOW: Does this change in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">attitude</span> by HHS mean that if there is some new <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pandemic</span> that starts to develop around the world, that we would have to rely on Europe to create a new mRNA vaccine for us, and it would not be available here?

JEFF COLLER: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the fact is that many medical <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">professionals</span> state that it’s not a question of if bird flu, for example, goes pandemic. It’s more of a question of when. It could be five years. It could be 10 years. But it’s highly likely that it will eventually go pandemic. And the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">consequences</span> of that, of course, are huge. And so we have to be ready to respond from a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">national</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">security</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">standpoint</span>.

And if we have to rely upon <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">foreign</span> countries to produce vaccines for us, what sort of risk does that put us in from a country? And it’s not just Europe that’s doubling down on this technology. It’s China. And China is probably going to be the world leader very soon, not only in mRNA research, but in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">biotechnology</span> in general. And it wouldn’t be <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">unheard</span> of that in two or three years time, your vaccines will have a Made in China label.

IRA FLATOW: But my question is also about, even if you had the vaccine made in China, and FDA does not like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">approval</span> of that kind of vaccine, it would not possibly be available here.

JEFF COLLER: That’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">correct</span>, 100%.

IRA FLATOW: Wow. Any of this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">scare</span> you at all?

JEFF COLLER: Oh, yeah, It totally scares me from a security standpoint. Is that, again, this is a technology that is highly effective. And the COVID vaccines were some of the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">safest</span> and most <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">efficacious</span> vaccines that were ever rolled out. And so to have that power at our hands for response to the next pandemic and to not use it is– it’s not just scary. It’s also <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">irresponsible</span>.

But that goes beyond <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">infectious</span> disease as well because we’re using this technology for other important <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">indications</span>, like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pancreatic</span> cancer. Pancreatic cancer has about a 95% death rate. And there’s a study that came out in 2020. When they <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">injected</span> that mRNA into those patients, 50% of the patients <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">responded</span>. That’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">incredible</span> to have a technology that might be a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cure</span> for pancreatic cancer. And it’s not just that. It’s rare diseases as well.

I mean, I hope that people realize that scientists like myself, we work for the American people because we’re paid by American <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">taxpayer</span> dollars. And we give back by trying to improve the lives of everyone every day. And we need to continue to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">invest</span> into that. So I mean, I really hope that we’ll rise above this moment and realize that we all want the best for our families.

IRA FLATOW: Well, I want to thank you for taking time to be with us today.

JEFF COLLER: Yeah, thank you, Ira.
