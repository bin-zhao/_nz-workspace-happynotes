FLORA LICHTMAN: This is Science Friday, I’m Flora Lichtman. Later in the hour, we’ll revisit a novel approach to fighting pancreatic cancer. But first, it’s time to check in on the state of science.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Local science stories of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">national</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">significance</span>.

In 1995, 30 years ago, wolves were reintroduced to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Yellowstone</span> National Park and have done <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">remarkably</span> well.

It’s a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">conservation</span> success story, but it’s not been a straight path out of the woods, which my next guest reported on. Heath <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Druzin</span> is the host of the podcast <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Howl</span> from <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Boise</span> State Public Radio and the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Idaho</span> Capital Sun. Heath, welcome to Science Friday.

HEATH DRUZIN: Great to be here.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Heath, why did you take this story on?

HEATH DRUZIN: A big part of why I took this story on is that I’ve had a long standing <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fascination</span> with wildlife. I spent a lot of time in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">outdoors</span> in places where wolves live. I live in Idaho and I’m a bit of a National Park <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">junkie</span>, so I travel around to the west a lot.

And both recreating out there and being a reporter in that area, I heard a lot of really strong feelings about wolves, like over the top feelings. That just even animals like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">grizzly</span> bears just don’t really <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">inspire</span> the same feelings.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Like what? Give me an example.

HEATH DRUZIN: There are people who love wolves so much that they even say they want to be a wolf. And people who just assign these sort of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">mythical</span> qualities, and they’re wild animals. And then on the other side, you’ve got people who have <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tortured</span> them.

Wolves have been found with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">horrific</span> injuries from torture. Not just <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">poaching</span>, but really wanting to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">inflict</span> pain. And so I really want to know why. I wanted to why. I still want to know. I think I learned a little bit about that, but I just want to why these animals in particular inspire such over-the-top feelings in people. Why wolves?

FLORA LICHTMAN: OK, let’s go back in time. How did we get into this situation where wolves were basically <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wiped</span> out in the lower 48 states?

HEATH DRUZIN: I guess that gets to a little bit of what I was talking about with over the top feelings. There’s a lot of wolf mythology out there. In Europe where a lot of early American <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">settlers</span> came from. You got the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fairy</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tails</span> that everybody knows about, and you’ve got a lot of negative feelings. Because wolves were seen as dangerous, and obviously wolves do eat <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">livestock</span> from time to time.

So when settlers came to America, and especially when they came west, they had animals. They had cattle and sheep especially. And wolves don’t always mix with livestock very well. So basically what happened was as Americans moved west, they <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">systematically</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">exterminated</span> wolves to protect <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cattle</span> and sheep. And they basically wiped wolves out in the west by, it depends who you talk to. But about the 1940s, there were virtually no wolves left in the west.

FLORA LICHTMAN: OK, so what happened 30 years ago when wolves were reintroduced? How did that happen?

HEATH DRUZIN: You have to back up 20 years before that when the Endangered Species Act was signed into law by Richard <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Nixon</span>, actually. One of the first animals that was protected under the Endangered Species Act was wolves. And so that started this 20 year program to figure out how to get them back.

And a lot of Western states were not very excited about it. It’s cattle country. It’s sheep country. But the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">federal</span> government essentially <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">overruled</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">rancher</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">objections</span> and said, we’re going to release them in Yellowstone and central Idaho and hopefully restore some balance to the ecosystem with an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">apex</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">predator</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Is this right? I read that this <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">proposal</span> had more than 160,000 public comments?

HEATH DRUZIN: We talked to people who were there. They talked about <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">screaming</span> matches with federal officials at these town halls and small towns in Idaho and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Montana</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Wyoming</span>. And, I mean, there were death threats. So, yeah, it was extremely controversial. People had very strong feelings, both pro and anti wolf. And there wasn’t a lot of common ground back then.

FLORA LICHTMAN: So what happened since? How have their populations <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fared</span>?

HEATH DRUZIN: It is one of the great comeback stories in nature. Depending on what numbers you look at, there’s roughly 3,000 wolves. That’s a huge comeback, and it really exceeded anyone’s <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wildest</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">expectations</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Really?

HEATH DRUZIN: Oh yeah. The federal government was talking about, hopefully having a population of a few hundred and now we’re at a few thousand. So people who like wolves are excited. People who don’t like wolves feel like they were sold a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">bill</span> of goods.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Well, let’s talk about that. How people are feeling now. You spoke with <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Rusty</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Kramer</span>, who runs a farm and also leads the Idaho <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Trappers</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Association</span>.

RUSTY KRAMER They are a large <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">apex</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">predator</span>, and they need a lot of room and a lot of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ungulates</span>, a lot of food to eat. And in my opinion, you just don’t have that in Idaho anymore. The people that think that they can <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">coexist</span> are just in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">la la land</span>, in my opinion, because they can’t exist with this much <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ag (agriculture)</span> on the landscape.

HEATH DRUZIN: <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Rusty</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Kramer</span>, in addition to being a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">trapper</span>, is an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">alfalfa</span> farmer. And he says, wolves push <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">elk</span> down into his alfalfa fields for safety, basically, and they <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">trample</span> the fields and hurt his business. And that really does <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">illustrate</span> a pretty wide view of wolves in places like Idaho. People think they hurt <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">ranchers</span> and they hurt farmers.

Now, I do have to say he’s talking about <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">elk</span> and fish and game officials in <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">anti-wolf</span> states will tell you elk <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">herds</span> are really healthy and at their <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">healthiest</span> in a long time. So there’s definitely some <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">debate</span> over some of those points.

FLORA LICHTMAN: How has the comeback of wolves changed the ecosystem out west?

HEATH DRUZIN: That was one of the most <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">fascinating</span> parts of my reporting. Scientists think that wolves have really <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dramatically</span> changed the landscape. Well beyond predator – prey relationships. There’s a term called the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">trophic</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">cascade</span>. So to put it simply, wolves eat elk and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">deer</span>, and that makes elk and deer nervous. That means that they’re not staying in one place very long. And when they do stay in one place too long, they tend to <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">overgraze</span>, and then they <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">chew</span> young trees like <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">aspens</span> to the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">nub</span>, and they never grow tall.

And so there was a recent study, actually, after we released the podcast, and it showed that aspen trees are doing better than they have in 80 years in Yellowstone. They attribute that a lot to the reintroduction of wolves and other predator populations coming up. That goes all the way down to river ecosystems, where aspens and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">willows</span> do better, and they grow next to rivers, they provide <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">shade</span> that helps <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">trout</span>, it helps <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">beavers</span> build <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">dams</span>. There’s these crazy connections with animals that you would think really have nothing to do with wolves.

FLORA LICHTMAN: You also spoke with members of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Indigenous</span> communities. What did you hear?

HEATH DRUZIN: We spent some time on the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Nez</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Perce</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">reservation</span> in Idaho. The Nez Perce <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tribe</span> played this largely <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">unsung</span> role in wolf <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">recovery</span>. Basically, Idaho in 1995 <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">boycotted</span> the reintroduction process. They didn’t like wolves, and they <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">refused</span> to participate with the federal government. So the Nez Perce tribe stepped up and basically said, well, we’ll be the state <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">agency</span>. We’ll help you out. And for more than a decade, they did a lot on the ground monitoring of wolves and studying of wolves, and seeing how they were doing as their population <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">grew</span>.

We talked to a lot of members of the tribe, including an <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">elder</span> who actually was born right as wolves were dying out. He told us a lot about the belief system that the Nez Perce have, and how wolves occupy a really important space that traditional hunters even study them to learn how to hunt. And that their loss was this really big hole, both in nature, around them and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">culturally</span>.

FLORA LICHTMAN: What is the current <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">protection</span> status for wolves?

HEATH DRUZIN: It’s complicated. So wolves are protected by the Endangered Species <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Act</span> in most places in America. But they are not protected in Idaho, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Montana</span>, <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Wyoming</span>. And those are the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">strongholds</span> for wolves in the West. Most western wolves live in those three states. So there those states are able to do what they want.

It’s kind of open season. You can hunt wolves through almost any means possible. Wolves have gone from the highest protections of the federal government to less protected than just about any animal out there in the three states that are most important to their survival. That does have a lot of people nervous.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Do you think they’re at risk for being <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wiped out</span> in those states?

HEATH DRUZIN: Among the many surprises that we ran into in our reporting for this project. I think one of the biggest ones was that a lot of scientists are concerned that wolves might be in trouble again. Not that they’re on the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">brink</span> of <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">extinction</span>, but that they’re going in the wrong direction.

FLORA LICHTMAN: I want to wrap up with another personal experience you had, and I’m just going to intro it with some sound that you recorded. [WOLVES HOWLING]

HEATH DRUZIN: It still gives me <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">chills</span>. I was hiking by myself in Yellowstone, and all of a <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sudden</span>, about 200 feet in front of me, I saw something moving in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">sagebrush</span>. It was a large, black female wolf with three <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">pups</span>. She actually stopped and sat on her <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">haunches</span> and <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">stared at</span> me with her <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">tongue</span> out for 30 seconds. And then she <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wandered</span> off, and they all started <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">howling</span>. I was right there. I was <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">surrounded</span> by howls, and I was by myself in the <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">wilderness</span>. It was the most <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">thrilling</span> wildlife experience I’ve ever had.

FLORA LICHTMAN: Well, I think that’s the perfect place to leave it. Thank you Heath.

HEATH DRUZIN: Thank you so much.
