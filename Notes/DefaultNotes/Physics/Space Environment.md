Yes — they really are almost everywhere in space.

- **Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs):** These come from outside our solar system, accelerated by supernovae and other astrophysical events. They’re constantly streaming through space, at nearly the speed of light, and they don’t just “miss” objects — they go right through unless blocked by thick shielding.
    
- **Solar energetic particles (SEPs):** These erupt from the Sun during solar flares and coronal mass ejections. They come in bursts, but when they happen, they can flood space with high-energy protons and ions.
    
- **Background radiation:** Even far from stars, space has a low but steady flux of energetic photons (gamma rays, X-rays) and particles.
    

That’s why spacecraft electronics, astronauts, and even future Mars missions worry so much about radiation — it’s not localized “spots” of rays, it’s more like a constant drizzle of energetic particles everywhere, with occasional “storms” from the Sun.

Would you like me to compare this to Earth’s situation — why we don’t notice these particles here?
